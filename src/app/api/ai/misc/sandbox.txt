With Trump almost getting shot there have been a lot questions that are being asked. The question I would like to discus today is how social media is playing a factor in it, particularly short form content. 



With the raise of short form content within minutes can 10 different people validating or promoting a ideals and frustration of a person that is so far from/occur such few times in the real world that it leads to a warped view of the world  which can lead people to develop extreme emotions. The social media 'algorithm' seems like it promates increasingly extremist views , alough it might just be human brain that interpret it that way. but the 'algorithm' definatly does its part in promating more of the content a user like, leading a very homogeneous source of information. which in turn leads to a very one side view of the world.



The naive solution to this would be to make social media algorithm more diverse and have it recommend user a varity of content but this would make the algorithm inherently worse because now it is not recommending what the user. I feel like there is some middle ground that companies should find in deciding there recommendations.
