e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e me   uh how's everybody doing it's great to see all these people here to here to all these people who are here to hear me talk so I appreciate that uh that's all right so my name is Mike delos Santos uh the owner of Mike D's barbecue a small community restaurant and barbecue shop in East Durham I'm a husband a proud father and I'm here today to talk about what's at stake for our families and our communities in this upcoming election and what is possible if we elect vice president kamla Harris as parents we're always thinking about the future and we want a world where our children can Thrive raising a family is hard work and working hard is hard work work oh yeah doing both can feel impossible and we need leaders that understand that and that's why electing Comm Harris is so important vice president Harris is standing up for families and fighting to lower costs just like she has done her entire career she sees what folks are going through like the families in my community who are struggling to pay bills stretching a budget to afford groceries scam scrambling to afford medication to live access to Affordable Health Care is personal to my family uh in 2012 our son Aaron passed away after bravely battling hypoplastic left heart syndrome that's why it means so much to me that the vice president is working to make sure everyone can get access to the care they need no matter what their income is she's working to lower prescription drug costs which make a huge difference for people people across this country and North Carolina at Mike D's we're all about Community from our customers to the folks on staff who came in early today so I could be here uh come by at 4:00 for dinner but as housing cost rise it's getting harder and harder for our community to thrive and though I love what I do you know it's hard to build a business and work hard in a city that sometimes you can't even afford to live in yourself especially when you're working hard to make sure that your employees make a living wage I've seen how important it is to have leaders who are fighting for people like us and I've seen the damage that occurs when leaders put their own interest ahead of our families amid the grief of losing our child we opened Mike D uh in 2013 as a barbecue sauce company uh during the pandemic we had to Pivot as things shut down uh and we've expanded to the restaurant that we are in now we saw the way that Trump left small business owners behind we know that he'll only work to make the rich richer even at our expense have given another chance on the other hand vice president Harris has made it a priority to help small business access the capital they need to get started and to grow it's very important I'm here today because we have a choice for ourselves and our children for businesses and the communities we invest in vice president Harris will always fight for Working Families like mine we can and will elect vice president Harris and Governor Tim Walls it is my honor to introduce the next president of the United States pela Harris can we hear from Mike B hello family and friends oh it's good to be back in North Carolina

Governor attorney general Josh Stein he's doing incredible work he's going to be an extraordinary Governor Representatives Adam Manning fushi and niichel thank you all for your support for your friendship for your leadership chair Thomas of the Wake County Board of Commissioners thank you for all that you do and to all the leaders that are here today including the students and instructors here at Wake Tech North north thank you thank you so thank you all so listen um this election I do strongly believe is about two very different Visions for our nation one ours focused on the future and the other focused on the past we see that contrast clearly in many ways including when it comes to how we think about the economy so our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office at that time we sadly remember the millions of Americans that were out of work we were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history and today by virtually every measure our economy is the strongest in the world we have created 16 million new jobs we've made historic investments in infrastructure in chips Manufacturing in clean energy and new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3% and as president of the United States it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress still we know that many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives costs are still too high and on a deeper level for too many people no matter how much they work it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead as president I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that Advance their Economic Security stability and dignity together we will build what I call an opportunity economy an opportunity economy an economy where every one can compete and have a real chance to succeed everyone regardless of who they are or where they start has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children and where we remove the barriers to opportunity so anyone who wants to start a business or Advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging and encouraging Innovative Technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road as president I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America to create good jobs achieve broad-based growth and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world and key key to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class it is essential the middle class is one of America's greatest strengths and to protect it then we must defend basic principles such as your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life such as no child should have to grow up in poverty such as after years of hard work you you should be able to retire with dignity and you should be able to join a union if you choose building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong America is strong so in the weeks to come I will address in Greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy and today I will focus on one element that's on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store and that is lowering the cost of living so every day across our nation families talk about their plans for the future their Ambitions their aspirations for themselves for their children and they talk about how they're going to be able to actually achieve them financially because look the bills add up food rent gas back to school clothes prescription medication after all that for many families there's m not much left at the end of the month I grew up in a middle class household for most of my childhood we were renters my mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home I was a teenager when that day finally came and I can remember so well how excited she was I kind of understood what it meant but we called her mommy mommy was so excited it just made us excited that she was so excited later in college I worked at McDonald's to earn spending money well some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck they worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food that only gets harder when the cost of living goes up when I am elected president I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase Economic Security for all Americans as president I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans like the cost of food we all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high a lot a loaf of bread cost 50% more today than it did before the pandemic ground beef is up almost 50% many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades and while many grocery chains pass along these savings others still aren't look I know most businesses are creating jobs contributing to our economy and playing by the rules but some are not and that's just not right and we need to take action when that is the case at as a attorney general in California I went after companies that illegally increased prices including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics High I won more than1 billion dollar for consumers so believe me as president I will go after the Bad actors and I will work to pass the first ever Federal ban on PR price gauging on food my plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead that's right we will help the food industry become more competitive because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy more competition means lower prices for you and your families now compare what Donald Trump plans to do he wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries that will devastate Americans it will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs a trump tax on gas a trump tax on food a trump tax on clothing a trump tax on overthe counter medication and you know economists have done the math Donald Trump's plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year at this moment when everyday prices are too high he will make them even higher as president I'll T and take on the issue of the cost of Health Care as attorney general I took on insurance companies and big Pharma and got them to lower their prices and together with President Biden we've gone even further we capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors we let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors and just yesterday and just yesterday we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life saving drugs and I pledge to continue this progress I'll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support not only our seniors and demand transparency from The middlemen Who operate between big farma and the insurance companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine two months ago I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score and I will work as president with States like here in North Carolina Roy Cooper thank you again to cancel medical debt for more and more Millions more Americans as for Donald Trump well he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act which 45 million Americans rely on 45 million Americans rely on it for healthcare that would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions we all remember what that was and we're not going back we're not going back we're not going back and and remember and this is why we're not going back cuz we do remember he tried to cut Medicare every year he was President threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on and according to his project 2025 agenda he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs the cost of prescription drugs and Insulin cost well we've come too far to let that happen so we're not going back on that and let's talk about the cost of housing so now the housing market can be complicated but look I'm not new to this issue as State Attorney General I drafted and helped pass a homeowner Bill of Rights one of the first in America and during the Foreclosure crisis I took on the big Bank s for predatory lending with many of my colleagues including Roy Cooper and won $20 billion for California families when I was attorney general so I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market and I know what home ownership means it's more than a financial transaction it's so much more than that it's more than a house home ownership and what that means it's a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work it's Financial Security it represents what you will be able to do for your children and sadly right now it is Out Of Reach for far too many American families there's a serious housing shortage in many places it's too difficult to build and it's driving prices up as president I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need both to rent and to buy we will take Dam down barriers and cut red tape including at the state and local levels and by the end of my first term we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class and we will do that together we will do that together and and we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middleclass Americans not just investors cuz you know some corporate landlords some of them buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and a Apartments then they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices and it can make it impossible then for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home some corporate landlords collude with each other that's right to set artificially High rental prices often using algorithms in price fixing software to do it it's anti anti-competitive and it drives up costs I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices we also know that as the price of housing has gone up the size of down payments have gone up as well even if aspiring homeowners save for years it often still is not enough so in addition while we work on the housing shortage my Administration will provide firsttime home buyers with $225,000 to help with the down payment on a new home we can do this we can do this all to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings so that's my plan but here's what Donald Trump would do if his project 2025 agenda is put into effect it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage he's got it backward we should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home not less finally there's one more way I will help families deal with rising cost and that's by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money under my plan more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle class and working Americans the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit through which millions of Americans with Children got to keep more of their hard-earned income we know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues including child poverty we know it works so as president I'll not only restore that tax cut but expand it we will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child's life now think what that means think what that means that is a vital vital year of critical development of a child and the cost can really add up especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else and we will do this while reducing the deficit compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do do he plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits and that's on top of the $2 trillion doll tax cut he already signed into law when he was president which by the way overwhelmingly overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans in corporations and exploded the national deficit you know I think that if you want to know who someone cares about look who they fight for look who they fight for Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations we I will fight to give money back to working and middle class Americans so I'll end with this two days ago Donald Trump was here in North Carolina he said he was going to talk about the economy I think you all watched you know what I'm about to say but he offered no serious plans to reduce cost for middle class f amilies no plan to expand access to housing or health care and that actually I think for most of us was not surprising because we already know his plans we know the project 2025 agenda so there's a choice in this election Donald Trump's plans to devastate the middle class punish working people and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans and on the other hand when I'm elected president what we'll do what we will do to bring down cost increase the security and stability financially of your family and expand opportunity for working and middle class Americans so now now now is the time to chart a new way forward now is the time to chart a new way forward to build Way Forward new way for forward a new way forward wayward way forward to build to build an America where everyone's work is rewarded and talents are valued where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead so I thank you North Carolina we're going to get this done and with your help God bless you and God bless the United States of America God bless you e
