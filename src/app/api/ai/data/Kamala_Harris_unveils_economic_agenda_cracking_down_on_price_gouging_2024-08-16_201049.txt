 >> SO THANK YOU ALL. SO LISTEN, THIS ELECTION, I DO STRONGLY BELIEVE IS ABOUT TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS FOR OUR NATION. ONE, OURS FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE AND THE OTHER FOCUSED ON THE PAST. WE SEE THAT CONTRASTS CLEARLY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. SO OUR COUNTRY HAS COME A LONG WAY, SAYS PRESIDENT BIDEN AND I TOOK OFFICE AT THAT TIME. WE SADLY REMEMBER THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THAT WERE OF WORK. WE WERE FACING ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISES IN MODERN HISTORY. AND TODAY, BY VIRTUALLY EVERY MEASURE, OUR ECONOMY IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE CREATED MILLION NEW JOBS. WE'VE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, IN CHIPS, MANUFACTURING, IN CLEAN ENERGY AND NEW NUMBERS. THIS WEEK ALONE SHOW THAT INFLATION IS DOWN UNDER 3%. AND AS PRESIDENT, THE UNITED STATES, WHERE IT WILL BE MY INTENTION TO BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION OF THIS PROGRESS. STILL, WE KNOW THAT MANY AMERICANS DON'T YET FEEL THAT PROGRESS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. COSTS ARE TOO HIGH AND ON A DEEPER LEVEL FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY WORK, IT FEELS HARD TO JUST BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BE LASER FOCUSED ON CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT ADVANCE THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY STABILITY AND DIGNITY TOGETHER ,WE WILL BUILD WHAT I CALL AN ECONOMY AN OPPORTUNITY ECONOMY . ANY WHERE EVERYONE CAN COMPETE AND HAVE A REAL CHANCE TO SUCCEED. EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY START, HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD WEALTH FOR THEMSELVES AND CHILDREN AND WHERE WE REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY. >> SO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO START A BUSINESS OR ADVANCE THEIR CAREER CAN ACCESS THE TOOLS AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DO SO. I WILL FOCUS ON CUTTING NEEDLESS BUREAUCRACY AND UNNECESSARY REGULATORY RED TAPE AND ENCOURAGE CHANGE AND ENCOURAGING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES WHILE PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND CREATING A STABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WITH CONSISTENT AND TRANSPARENT RULES OF THE ROAD. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BRING TOGETHER LABOR WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AND MAJOR COMPANIES TO. INVEST IN AMERICA TO CREATE GOOD, ACHIEVE BROAD BASED GROWTH, AND ENSURE THAT AMERICA CONTINUES TO THE FUTURE AND LEAD THE WORLD. >> AND WE KEY TO CREATING THIS OPPORTUNITY ECONOMY IS BUILDING OUR MIDDLE CLASS. IT IS ESSENTIAL. >> THE MIDDLE CLASS IS ONE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST, AND TO PROTECT IT, THEN WE MUST BASIC PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOUR SALARY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WITH A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE, SUCH AS NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO GROW UP IN POVERTY, SUCH AS AFTER YEARS OF HARD WORK, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JOIN A UNION IF YOU CHOOSE BUILDING UP THE CLASS WILL BE A DEFINING GOAL OF MY PRESIDENCY BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE WHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS IS STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. SO IN THE WEEKS TO COME, I WILL ADDRESS IN GREATER DETAIL MY PLANS, BUILD AN OPPORTUNITY ECONOMY. AND TODAY I WILL FOCUS ON ONE ELEMENT THAT'S ON THE MINDS OF MANY AMERICANS AS THEY PAY THEIR BILLS AT, THE KITCHEN TABLE, OR WALK THE AISLES OF A GROCERY STORE. >> AND THAT IS LOWERING THE COST OF LIVING. SO EVERY DAY ACROSS OUR NATION, FAMILIES TALK ABOUT THEIR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE, THEIR AMBITIONS ,THEIR ASPIRATIONS FOR THEMSELVES, FOR CHILDREN. AND THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THEM FINANCIALLY. BECAUSE, LOOK, THE BILL THAT UP ,FOOD, RENT, GAS, BACK TO SCHOOL, CLOTHES PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION, AFTER ALL, FOR MANY FAMILIES, THERE IS NOT MUCH AT THE END OF THE MONTH. I GREW UP IN MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEHOLD FOR MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD, WE WERE RENTERS. MY MOTHER SAVED FOR WELL OVER A DECADE TO BUY A HOME. I WAS A TEENAGER WHEN THAT DAY FINALLY CAME, AND I CAN REMEMBER SO WELL HOW EXCITED SHE WAS. I KIND OF UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANT, BUT WE CALLED HER MOMMY. MOMMY WAS SO EXCITED. IT JUST MADE US EXCITED THAT SHE WAS SO EXCITED. LATER, COLLEGE, I WORKED AT MCDONALD'S TO EARN SPENDING MONEY. WELL, SOME OF THE PEOPLE I WORKED WITH WERE RAISING FAMILIES ON THAT PAYCHECK. THEY WORKED SECOND OR EVEN THIRD JOBS TO PAY RENT AND BUY FOOD. THAT ONLY GETS HARDER WHEN THE COST LIVING GOES UP. WHEN I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT WILL MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY TO BRING DOWN COSTS AND INCREASE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR ALL AMERICANS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE ON THE HIGH COSTS THAT MATTER MOST TO MOST AMERICANS, LIKE THE COST OF FOOD. WE ALL KNOW THAT PRICES WENT UP DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THE SUPPLY CHAINS SHUT DOWN AND FAILED. BUT OUR SUPPLY CHAINS HAVE NOW IMPROVED AND PRICES ARE STILL TOO HIGH YET A LOAF OF BREAD COSTS 50% MORE TODAY THAN IT DID BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. GROUND BEEF IS UP ALMOST 50%. >> MANY OF THE BIG FOOD COMPANIES ARE SEEING THEIR HIGHEST PROFITS IN TWO DECADES. AND WHILE MANY GROCERY CHAINS PASS ALONG THESE SAVINGS, OTHERS STILL AREN'T. LOOK, I KNOW MOST BUSINESSES ARE CREATING JOBS, CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY, AND PLAYING BY THE RULES. BUT SOME ARE NOT. AND THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. AND WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THAT IS THE CASE AT. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA, I WENT AFTER A COMPANIES THAT ILLEGALLY INCREASED PRICES INCLUDING WHOLESALERS THAT INFLATED THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AND COMPANIES THAT CONSPIRED WITH COMPETITORS TO KEEP PRICES OF ELECTRONICS. I WON MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR CONSUMERS. SO BELIEVE ME, AS PRESIDENT I WILL GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS AND I WILL WORK TO PASS THE FIRST EVER FEDERAL BAN ON PRICE GOUGING, FOOD. MY PLAN INCLUDE NEW PENALTIES FOR OPPORTUNISTIC COMPANIES THAT EXPLOIT CRISES AND BREAK THE RULES. AND WE WILL SUPPORT SMALLER FOOD BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO PLAY BY THE RULES AND GET AHEAD. WE WILL HELP THE FOOD INDUSTRY BECOME MORE BECAUSE I BELIEVE COMPETITION IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY. MORE COMPETITION MEANS LOWER PRICES FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. >> NOW COMPARE WHAT DONALD TRUMP PLANS TO DO. HE WANTS TO IMPOSE WHAT IS, IN EFFECT, A NATIONAL SALES TAX ON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS AND BASIC NECESSITIES THAT WE IMPORT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT WILL DEVASTATE AMERICANS. IT WILL MEAN HIGHER PRICES ON JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF YOUR DAILY NEEDS. A TRUMP TAX ON GAS. A TRUMP TAX ON FOOD. A TRUMP TAX. CLOTHING. A TRUMP TAX. ON OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION. AND YOU KNOW, ECONOMISTS DONE THE MATH. DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN WOULD COST TYPICAL FAMILY 3000 $900 A YEAR . >> AT THIS MOMENT, WHEN EVERYDAY PRICES ARE HIGH, HE WILL MAKE THEM EVEN HIGHER AS PRESIDENT. I'LL TACK AND TAKE ON THE ISSUE OF THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I TOOK ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND BIG PHARMA AND GOT THEM TO LOWER THEIR PRICES. AND TOGETHER WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN, WE'VE GONE EVEN FURTHER. WE KEPT THE PRICE OF INSULIN AT $35 A MONTH. AND THE TOTAL COST AND THE TOTAL COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AT $2,000 A YEAR FOR SENIORS. WE LET MEDICARE NEGOTIATE LOWER DRUG FOR SENIORS. AND JUST YESTERDAY AND JUST YESTERDAY, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE LOWERING PRICE BY UP TO 80% FOR TEN MORE LIFE SAVING DRUGS . AND I PLEDGE TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRESS. I'LL LOWER THE COST OF INSULIN AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR EVERYONE WITH YOUR SUPPORT, NOT ONLY OUR SENIORS AND DEMAND TRANSPARENCY FROM THE MIDDLEMEN WHO OPERATE BETWEEN BIG PHARMA AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO USE OPAQUE PRACTICES TO RAISE YOUR DRUG PRICES AND PROFIT OFF YOUR NEED FOR MEDICINE. TWO MONTHS AGO, I ANNOUNCED THAT DEBT WILL NO LONGER BE USED AGAINST YOU. >> CREDIT SCORE. AND I WILL WORK AS PRESIDENT WITH STATES LIKE HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA. ROY COOPER, THANK YOU AGAIN TO CANCEL MEDICAL DEBT FOR MORE AND MORE, MILLIONS MORE AMERICANS. AS FOR DONALD TRUMP, WELL, HE WANTS TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH 45 MILLION AMERICANS RELY ON, 45 MILLION AMERICANS RELY ON IT FOR HEALTH CARE. THAT WOULD TAKE US BACK TO A TIME WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD DENY PEOPLE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. WE ALL REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS AND WE'RE NOT GOING BACK THAT. >> AND REMEMBER AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE NOT GOING BACK, BECAUSE WE DO REMEMBER HE TRIED TO CUT MEDICARE EVERY YEAR HE WAS PRESIDENT THREATENING A PROGRAM THAT TENS MILLIONS OF SENIORS COUNT ON. AND ACCORDING TO HIS PROJECT, 2025 AGENDA, HE INTENDS TO UNDO OUR WORK TO BRING DOWN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND INSULIN COSTS. WELL, WE'VE COME TOO FAR TO LET THAT HAPPEN. SO WE'RE NOT GOING BACK ON THAT. >> AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COST OF HOUSING. SO NOW THE HOUSING MARKET CAN BE COMPLICATED. >> BUT LOOK, NOT NEW TO THIS ISSUE. AS STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, I DRAFTED AND HELPED PASS A HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. >> ONE OF THE FIRST IN AMERICA. AND DURING THE FORECLOSURE, I TOOK ON THE BIG BANKS FOR PREDATORY LENDING WITH MANY MY COLLEAGUES, INCLUDING ROY COOPER, AND $120 BILLION FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. >> WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY. SO I HOW TO FIGHT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING EXPLOITED IN THE HOUSING MARKET. >> AND I KNOW WHAT HOME OWNERSHIP MEANS. IT'S MORE A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. IT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. IT'S MORE THAN A HOUSE. ALL RIGHT. HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WHAT THAT MEANS. A SYMBOL OF THE PRIDE THAT COMES WITH HARD WORK. >> YES, IT'S FINANCIAL SECURITY. >> IT REPRESENTS WHAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO FOR YOUR CHILDREN. AND SADLY, RIGHT NOW, IT IS OUT OF REACH FOR FAR TOO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES. THERE'S A SERIOUS HOUSING SHORTAGE IN MANY PLACES. IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO BUILD AND IT'S DRIVING PRICES UP. AS PRESIDENT I WILL WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY TO BUILD THE HOUSING WE NEED BOTH TO RENT AND, TO BUY. >> WE WILL TAKE DOWN BARRIERS AND CUT RED TAPE, INCLUDING AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. >> AND BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, WE WILL END AMERICA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE BY BUILDING 3 MILLION NEW HOMES AND RENTAL THAT ARE AFFORDABLE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND WE WILL DO THAT TOGETHER. WE WILL DO THAT TOGETHER. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THOSE HOMES ACTUALLY GO TO WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS, NOT JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOME LANDLORDS, SOME OF THEM BY DOZENS, IF NOT HUNDREDS OF HOUSES AND APARTMENTS. THEN THEY TURN THEM AROUND AND RENT THEM OUT AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES. AND IT CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE THEN FOR REGULAR TO BE ABLE TO BUY OR EVEN RENT A HOME. AND SOME CORPORATE LANDLORDS COLLUDE WITH EACH OTHER TO SET ARTIFICIALLY HIGH RENTAL PRICES, OFTEN USING ALGORITHMS AND PRICE FIXING SOFTWARE TO DO IT. IT'S ANTI-COMPETITIVE AND IT DRIVES UP COSTS. I WILL FIGHT FOR A LAW THAT CRACKS DOWN ON THESE PRACTICES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS THE PRICE OF HOUSING HAS GONE UP, THE SIZE OF DOWN PAYMENTS HAVE GONE UP AS WELL. EVEN IF ASPIRING HOMEOWNERS FOR YEARS, IT OFTEN STILL IS NOT ENOUGH. SO IN ADDITION, WHILE WE WORK ON THE HOUSING SHORTAGE, MY ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE FIRST TIME HOMEBUYER BUYERS WITH $25,000 TO HELP WITH THE DOWN PAYMENT ON A NEW HOME. WE DO IT CAN DO IT ALL TO MORE AMERICANS. EXPERIENCE THE PRIDE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE FINANCIAL SECURITY THAT IT REPRESENT AND BRINGS. SO THAT'S MY PLAN. BUT HERE'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD DO IF. HIS PROJECT 2025 AGENDA IS PUT INTO EFFECT. IT WILL ADD AROUND $1,200 A YEAR TO THE TYPICAL AMERICAN MORTGAGE. HE'S GOT IT BACKWARDS. WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE, TO BUY HOME, NOT LESS. FINALLY, THERE'S ONE MORE WAY I WILL HELP FAMILIES DEAL WITH THE RISING COST, AND THAT IS BY LETTING YOU KEEP MORE OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. UNDER MY PLAN, MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL GET A TAX CUT. AND WE WILL DO THIS BY RESTORING TWO TAX CUTS DESIGNED TO HELP MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING AMERICANS. THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND, THE CHILD TAX CREDIT, THROUGH WHICH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH CHILDREN GOT TO, KEEP MORE OF THEIR HARD EARNED INCOME. WE KNOW WORKS AND HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON SO MANY ISSUES, INCLUDING CHILD POVERTY. WE IT WORKS. SO AS PRESIDENT, I'LL NOT ONLY RESTORE THAT TAX CUT, BUT EXPAND IT. WE WILL PROVIDE $6,000 IN TAX RELIEF TO FAMILIES DURING FIRST YEAR OF A CHILD'S LIFE. >> NOW, THINK WHAT THAT MEANS. THINK WHAT THAT MEANS. >> THAT IS A VITAL, VITAL YEAR OF CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF A CHILD. AND THE COST CAN REALLY ADD UP, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PARENTS WHO NEED TO BUY DIAPERS AND CLOTHES AND A CAR SEAT. AND SO MUCH. AND WE WILL DO THIS WHILE REDUCING THE DEFICIT. COMPARE MY PLAN WITH WHAT DONALD TRUMP INTENDS TO DO. HE PLANS TO GIVE BILLIONS MASSIVE TAX CUTS YEAR AFTER YEAR. AND HE PLANS TO CUT CORPORATE TAXES BY OVER $1,000,000,000,000 EVEN AS THEY PULL IN RECORD PROFITS. AND THAT'S ON TOP OF THE $2 TRILLION TAX CUT HE ALREADY SIGNED INTO LAW WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT. WHICH, BY THE WAY, OVER WHELMING WE OVERWHELMINGLY WENT TO THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND CORPORATIONS AND EXPLODED THE NATIONAL DEFICIT. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT IF YOU WANT KNOW WHO SOMEONE CARES ABOUT, LOOK WHO THEY FIGHT FOR . THIS IS DONALD TRUMP FIGHTS FOR BILLIONAIRES AND LARGE CORPORATIONS. I WILL FIGHT TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS. >> SO I'LL END WITH THIS. TWO DAYS AGO, DONALD TRUMP WAS HERE. >> NORTH CAROLINA. >> HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. I THINK YOU ALL WATCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY . BUT HE OFFERED NO SERIOUS PLANS TO REDUCE COSTS FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. >> NO TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HOUSING OR HEALTH CARE. ALL RIGHT. AND THAT ACTUALLY, I THINK FOR MOST OF US WAS NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW HIS PLANS. >> WE KNOW THE 2025 AGENDA. SO THERE'S A CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP'S PLANS TO DEVASTATE THE MIDDLE CLASS, PUNISH WORKING PEOPLE AND MAKE THE COST OF LIVING GO UP FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. AND ON OTHER HAND, WHEN I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL DO WHAT WE WILL DO TO BRING DOWN COSTS, INCREASE THE SECURITY, STABILITY FINANCIALLY OF YOUR FAMILY, AND EXPAND UPWARD COMMUNITY FOR WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS. SO NOW, NOW, NOW IS THE TIME TO CHART A NEW WAY FORWARD. >> NOW IS THE TIME TO CHART A NEW WAY FORWARD TO BUILD A NEW WAY TO BUILD. >> TO BUILD AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE'S WORK IS REWARDED AND, TALENTS ARE VALUED. WHERE WE WITH LABOR AND BUSINESS TO STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN AND WHERE EVERYONE HAS THE NOT JUST TO GET BY, BUT TO GET AHEAD. SO I THANK YOU, NORTH CAROLINA. WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE. AND WITH YOUR HELP. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE
