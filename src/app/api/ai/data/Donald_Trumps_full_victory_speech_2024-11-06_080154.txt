Pennsylvania campaigning you know he sent the rocket up two weeks ago and I saw that rocket and I saw it coming down I saw it it was when it left it was beautiful shiny white when it came down it didn't look so pretty it was going 10,000 M an hour and it was burning like hell I said what happened to your paint job he said we've never made a paint that could withstand that kind of heat and uh but I saw it come down and turn around and it was you know it's like 22 stories tall by the way it looks a little smaller than that but it's big and it came down and down and you saw that fire burning and and I'm said only Elon can do this must be an Elon and I tell the story I told it last night I had a man on the phone I had the screen muted no sound I was talking to a very important man happens to be here and that very important guy one of the most important people and I would say the country actually but you know I was president and now it looks like I was going to be maybe president again so I figured I could ask him to hold so I asked him to hold and because of especially because you got to be president again they hold so I took the phone down and I'm looking at the screen I'm seeing this crazy thing that's going around and coming down it looks like it's going crash into the Gantry and I said oh no and I said do me a favor do you mind holding for a couple of I want to see this I thought it was a Space Age movie or something I put the phone down bad part I didn't pick it up for 45 minutes and he was holding but this spaceship came down and I saw those engines firing and it looked like it was over it was going to smash and then I saw the fire pour out from the left side and it put it straight and it came down so gently and then it wrapped those arms around it and it held it and just like you hold your baby at night your little baby and it was a beautiful thing to see and I called Elon I said Elon was that you he said yes it was I said who else can do that can Russia do it no can can China do it no can the United States do it other than you no nobody can do that I said that's why I love you Elon that's great and you know when we had the tragic hurricane Helen and

danger was unbelievable and the people from North Carolina came to me and they said would it be possible at all possible for you to speak to Elon Musk we need starlink I said what's starlink it's a form of communication so I called Elon and I'll tell you what he had and it was very dangerous people would die they had no communication all the wires went down I called Elon Musk I said Elon you

greatest people also maybe that's the most important thing this campaign this campaign has been so historic in so many ways we've built the biggest the broadest the most unified coalition they've never seen anything like it in all of American History they've never seen any young and old men and women rural and urban and we had them all helping us tonight when you think I mean I was looking at it I was watching it they had some great analysis of the people that voted for us nobody's ever seen anything like that they came from they came from all Corners Union non-union African American Hispanic American Asian American Arab American Muslim American we had everybody and it was beautiful it was a historic realignment uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense you know we're the party of Common Sense we want to have borders we want to have security we want to have things be good safe we want great education we want want a strong and powerful military and ideally we don't have to use it you know we had no Wars four years we had no Wars except we defeated Isis we defeated Isis in record time and but we had no Wars they said he will start a war I'm

most incredible future for our people yesterday as I stood at my last stop on the campaign TR I'll never be doing a rally again can you believe it I think we've done 900 rallies approximately from the can you imagine 900 91 something a lot of rallies and it was sad everybody was sad many people I said this is our last rally but now we're going on something that's far more important because the rallies were used for us to put be put in this position where we can really help our country that's what we're going to do we're going to make our country better than it ever has been and I said that many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason and that reason was to save our country and to restore America to Greatness and now we are going to fulfill that mission together that we're going to fulfill that mission the task before us will not be easy but I will bring every ounce of energy spirit and fight that I have in my soul to the job that you've entrusted to me this is a great job that there is no job like this this is the most important job in the world just as I did in my first term we had a great first term a great great first term I will govern by a simple motto

going to try we're going to try we have to try and it's going to happen success will bring us together I've seen that I've seen that I saw that in the first term when we became more and more successful people started coming together success is going to bring us together and we are going to start by all putting America first we have to put our country first for at least a period of time we have to fix it because together we can truly make America great again for all Americans so I want to just tell you what a great honor this is I want to thank you I will not let you down America's
