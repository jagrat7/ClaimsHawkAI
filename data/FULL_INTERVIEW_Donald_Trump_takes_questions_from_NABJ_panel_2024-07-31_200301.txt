WITH THESE THREE AT THIS CONVENTION. >> LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. THIS DISCUSSION CONTINUES DECADES LONG TRADITION DURING ELECTION YEARS OF INVITING JOURNALISTS TO DISCUSS THE POLICIES AND THEIR IMPACT WITH, THE CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THE IMPACT OF THOSE POLICIES, ESPECIALLY IN BLACK COMMUNITIES. FORMER PRESIDENTS GEORGE W BUSH, BARACK OBAMA AND BILL CLINTON HAVE ATTENDED THE NEWS CONVENTIONS EITHER PRESIDENTS OR AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN PAST YEARS, AND IT IS CURRENTLY IN CONVERSATION WITH VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS' TEAM TO SCHEDULE A Q&A EITHER IN PERSON OR VIRTUALLY IN SEPTEMBER. AS JOURNALISTS, WE USE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE BOTH TO INFORM OUR REPORTING, BUT ALSO TO HELP VOTERS UNDERSTAND THE CHOICES THAT THEY FACE IN A CONSEQUENTIAL AND HISTORIC ELECTION YEAR. >> AND D.J. HAS PARTNERED WITH POLITIFACT TO FACT CHECK THIS CONVERSATION IN REAL TIME. YOU CAN ACCESS THAT FEED ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING THE HASHTAG NABJ CHECK. AGAIN, THE HASHTAG IS NABJ. FACT. >> WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO AND WE DO NOT WANT TO WASTE ANY TIME. SO LET'S BRING OUT THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. WE SO APPRECIATE YOU GIVING US AN HOUR OF YOUR TIME. >> I WANT TO START BY ADDRESSING ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, SIR. A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO BE HERE TODAY. >> YOU HAVE PUSHED FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT SOME OF YOUR RIVALS FROM NIKKI HALEY TO FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA SAYING THAT THEY WERE NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS NOT TRUE. >> YOU HAVE TOLD FOUR CONGRESSWOMAN OF COLOR WHO WERE AMERICAN CITIZENS TO GO BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM. YOU HAVE USED WORDS LIKE ANIMAL AND RABBIT TO DESCRIBE BLACK ATTORNEYS. >> YOU'VE ATTACKED BLACK JOURNALISTS, CALLING THEM A LOSER SAYING THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY ASKED ARE, QUOTE, STUPID AND RACIST. YOU'VE HAD DINNER WITH A WHITE SUPREMACIST AT YOUR MAR-A-LAGO RESORT. SO MY QUESTION, SIR, NOW THAT YOU WERE ASKING BLACK SUPPORTERS TO VOTE FOR YOU, WHY SHOULD BLACK VOTERS TRUST YOU AFTER YOU HAVE USED LANGUAGE LIKE THAT? >> WELL, OF ALL, I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN ASKED THE QUESTION SO IN SUCH A HORRIBLE MANNER. >> FIRST QUESTION, YOU DON'T EVEN SAY HELLO, HOW ARE YOU? >> ARE YOU WITH ABC? BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE A FAKE NEWS NETWORK, A TERRIBLE NETWORK. >> AND I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT I CAME HERE IN GOOD SPIRIT. I LOVE THE BLACK POPULATION OF COUNTRY. I'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR THE BLACK POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING OPPORTUNITY ZONES WITH SENATOR TIM OF SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST PROGRAMS EVER FOR BLACK WORKERS AND BLACK ENTREPRENEURS AND DONE SO MUCH. AND, YOU KNOW, AND I SAY THIS. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WERE OUT OF MONEY, WERE STONE COLD BROKE, AND I SAVED THEM. AND I GAVE THEM LONG TERM FINANCING AND NOBODY ELSE WAS DOING IT. I THINK IT'S A VERY RUDE INTRODUCTION. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND LET ME GO A STEP FURTHER. I WAS INVITED HERE AND I WAS TOLD MY OPPONENT, WHETHER IT WAS BIDEN, KAMALA, I WAS TOLD MY OPPONENT WAS GOING TO HERE. IT TURNED OUT MY OPPONENT ISN'T HERE. YOU INVITED UNDER FALSE PRETENSE AND THEN YOU SAID YOU CAN'T DO IT WITH. WELL, YOU KNOW WHERE ZOOM SHE'S GOING TO DO A RESUME. SHE'S NOT COMING. AND THEN YOU WERE HALF AN HOUR LATE. JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND. I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOU TO BE LATE. THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR EQUIPMENT WORKING OR SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I WOULD I THINK IT'S A VERY NASTY QUESTION. AGAIN WHY I HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION WITH ANOTHER. I HAVE BEEN THE BEST PRESIDENT FOR THE BLACK POPULATION SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN. >> BETTER THAN MY OWN, BETTER THAN PRESIDENT JOHNSON IN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. >> YOU JUST START OFF THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD ,ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE 35 MINUTES LATE BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET YOUR EQUIPMENT TO WORK IN SUCH A HOSTILE MANNER. I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE. LET ME LET ME JUST ASK A FOLLOW UP, SIR, AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OTHER QUESTIONS HERE. >> SOME OF YOUR OWN SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL, HAVE LABELED VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS, WHO WAS THE FIRST BLACK AND ASIAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT ON A MAJOR PARTY AS A D.C. HIRE. IS THAT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU? >> AND WILL YOU TELL THOSE REPUBLICANS AND THOSE SUPPORTERS TO STOP IT? HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DEFINE TPA? GO AHEAD. HOW DO YOU DEFINE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION? OKAY. YEAH, GO AHEAD. IS THAT WHAT DEFINITION THAT IS? THAT THAT IS, GIVE ME A DEFINITION. AND WILL YOU GIVE ME DEFINITION? >> GIVE ME A DEFINITION. SO I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION TO DEFINE IT AND DEFINE THE. DEFINE IT FOR ME. IF I JUST DEFINED. SIR, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS ONLY ON THE TICKET BECAUSE SHE IS A BLACK WOMAN? WELL, I CAN SAY NO. I THINK IT'S MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO. I'VE KNOWN HER A LONG TIME, INDIRECTLY NOT DIRECTLY, VERY MUCH. >> AND SHE WAS ALWAYS OF INDIAN HERITAGE AND SHE WAS ONLY PROMOTING INDIAN HERITAGE. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS BLACK UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK. AND NOW SHE WANTS TO BE KNOWN AS BLACK. SO I KNOW. IS SHE INDIAN OR A BLACK? SHE IS ALWAYS IDENTIFIED AS A BLACK. I RESPECT. THE BLACK COLLEGE. I RESPECT EITHER ONE, BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T BECAUSE SHE WAS INDIAN ALL THE WAY. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE MADE A TURN AND SHE WENT SHE BECAME A BLACK. JUST TO CLEAR, SIR, I THINK I THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT, TOO. WHEN YOU ASK A CONTINUE IN A VERY HOSTILE, NASTY TONE. >> IT'S A DIRECT QUESTION, SIR. >> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS A I HIRE SOMEBODY? >> REALLY THAT I MEAN, I REALLY DON'T KNOW. COULD BE. COULD BE. THERE ARE SOME AND THERE ARE PLENTY. I KNOW THIS LADY RIGHT OVER THERE. HARRIS IS A FANTASTIC PERSON WHO JUST INTERVIEWED ME AT LENGTH. AND WE HAD A GREAT INTERVIEW. I THINK I HEARD YOU GET VERY GOOD RATINGS AND YOU TOLD ME IT WAS THE LONGEST ONE OF YOUR LIFE. SO WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION. >> LOOK, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY. I MEAN, IT IS NOT LOST ON US HOW DIVIDED WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. >> AND YOU WERE COMING TODAY. >> WE REALLY GOT TO SEE THAT WE WERE DIVIDED ALONG THE LINES OF RACE, ALONG THE LINES OF GENDER AND. >> THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF IN THIS MOMENT WHERE WE. WHY COME HERE? WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TODAY? >> MY MESSAGE IS TO STOP PEOPLE FROM INVADING OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE TAKING FRANKLY A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IT. BUT ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS AND A LOT OF THE JOURNALISTS IN THIS ROOM, I KNOW AND I HAVE RESPECT FOR A LOT OF THE JOURNALISTS IN THIS ROOM ARE BLACK. I WILL TELL YOU THAT. CUMMINGS COMING FROM THE BORDER ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPEN TO BE TAKING BLACK JOBS. YOU HAD THE BEST. >> WHAT EXACTLY IS A BLACK JOB OR A BLACK JOB? IS ANYBODY THAT HAS A JOB, THAT'S WHAT IT IS. ANYBODY THAT HAS IT. ALL RIGHT. AND THEY TAKE THAT THEY'RE TAKING THE EMPLOYMENT AWAY FROM BLACK PEOPLE. THEY'RE COMING IN AND THEY'RE COMING IN. THEY'RE INVADING. IT'S AN INVASION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, PROBABLY 15, 16, 17 MILLION PEOPLE. I HAVE A FEELING IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SAYING, WHAT'S THE FIRST GROUP OF PEOPLE THE BLACK POPULATION IS AFFECTED MOST BY THAT. AND KAMALA IS ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN AND SHE'S THE ARE SHE'S THE WORST BORDERS ARE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BORDERS LIKE THIS. SHE'S NEVER EVEN ESSENTIALLY BEEN SHE SAID SHE WAS THERE ONCE, BUT NOT THE RIGHT PART OF THE BORDER. SO SHE WAS A BORDER THAT SHE'S DONE A HORRIBLE. THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND THEY'RE TAKING BLACK JOBS AND HISPANIC JOBS. AND FRANKLY, THEY'RE TAKING UNION UNIONS ARE BEING VERY BADLY AFFECTED BY ALL OF THE MILLIONS PEOPLE THAT ARE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY. AND ONE THING HAS TO WE, AS WE DISCUSSED, MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN FROM MENTAL INSTITUTIONS, FROM PRISONS, FROM JAILS. THEY'RE GANG MEMBERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SETTING LOOSE THEIR PRISONERS. THEY'RE OPENING THEIR PRISONS AND THEIR MENTAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THEY'RE TAKING THEIR THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE, DRUG DEALERS, A GANG MEMBERS, AND THEY'RE BRINGING THEM INTO THE UNITED STATES. AND BY THE WAY, THEIR CRIME IS GOING DOWN AND OUR CRIME RATE IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER . I WANT TO GET INTO HOW YOU ADDRESS SOME THE ISSUES WITH BLACK COMMUNITIES. AND I SAY THAT PLURAL, BECAUSE WE LIVE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE DIFFERENT. WE'RE NOT ALL THE SAME. WE DON'T VOTE THE SAME. >> DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. IT'S NOT MONOLITHIC. SO IF YOU COME TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BIRTHS AND IS THE WEIGHT OF THE INFLATION ON THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. THE NONPROFIT MONEY MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL RECENTLY RELEASED DATA FROM ITS MID-YEAR ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE FOUND A 52% RISE IN PEOPLE WHO WERE SEEKING COUNSELING FOR BEING IN CREDIT DEBT. THEY'RE PAYING FOR FOOD THAT IS SKY HIGH ON THEIR CREDIT CARDS. AND NOW THEY CAN'T PAY THAT OFF. THE CREDIT COUNSELING NONPROFIT MAYA'S SAID, IS SAYING NOW THAT THEY'VE SEEN SURGES THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE WERE IN A PANDEMIC OF PEOPLE IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE, MUCH OF THAT FALLS ON THE SHOULDERS OF MOM SINGLE BLACK MOMS. >> WHEN YOU LOOK STATISTICALLY, HOW YOU TURN IT AROUND. >> WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY? SO, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S VERY HARD TO HEAR FOR WHATEVER REASON BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE BAD EQUIPMENT, BECAUSE I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THIS WOMAN WAS ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT. BUT IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO HEAR YOU. BUT I CAN HEAR EVERY OTHER WORD. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT, ACTUALLY. BUT SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY CAN FIX IT OR DO SOMETHING WITH IT, BUT I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN WITH IT. THE INFLATION IS ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING OUR MIDDLE CLASS, OUR CLASS, VIRTUALLY EVERY CLASS. INFLATION IS A IN OUR COUNTRY. INFLATION IS A COUNTRY BUSTER. IT BREAKS EVERY COUNTRY. AND WE HAD, IN MY OPINION, WORST INFLATION WE'VE HAD. THEY SAY IT'S 58 YEARS. BUT I THINK MUCH MORE THAN THAT, IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING. AND IF YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT, A LOT OF THINGS THEY DON'T INCLUDE LIKE INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATES WENT FROM 2.4% TO 10%. AND YOU CAN'T GET THE MONEY. PEOPLE BUY HOUSES. THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOUNG PEOPLE, YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE, THEY DON'T HAVE THE DREAM ANYMORE. THEY CAN'T BUY A HOUSE. THEY CAN'T BORROW THE MONEY BECAUSE THE COST OF THE MONEY, THEY CAN'T BUY IT BECAUSE OF THE COST OF HOUSING, BECAUSE THE COST TO BUILD IT BECAUSE OF INFLATION. INFLATION IS, A DISASTER. AND IT'S DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY. AND IT'S THE BLACK COMMUNITY PROBABLY AS MUCH. >> SO WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO? WE HAVE TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF ENERGY, AND THAT'S GOING TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF INFLATION. THIS WAS ALL STARTED WITH A BAD ENERGY POLICY BY JOE BIDEN. BY THE WAY, JUST IF I MIGHT, I WAS RUNNING AGAINST A MAN NAMED BIDEN. YOU PROBABLY SAW THAT. AND WAS LOSING VERY BADLY IN THE POLLS. AND THEN HE HAD A RATHER BAD DEBATE I WOULD SAY IT WAS A BAD DEBATE. I WOULD SAY IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST, WORST DEBATES HISTORY. AND HIS POLL NUMBERS CRASHED. AND INSTEAD OF SAYING, YOU KNOW, LET'S KEEP GOING AND MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENS THE OTHER WAY, THEY SAID, OH, WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE HIM. LET'S JUST REPLACE. THAT'S LIKE YOU'RE IN A FIGHT, A PRIZEFIGHTERS IN A FIGHT. HE'S NOT DOING WHAT YOU SAY. LET'S BRING IN ANOTHER FIGHTER. SO OUR WHOLE WAS GEARED TOWARD HIM AND NOW WE HAVE TO STICK IT TO HIM. BUT ULTIMATELY, IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE BAD POLICY. THEY HAVE POLICIES THAT OPEN BORDERS, UNBELIEVABLE OPEN BORDERS, HORRIBLE ENERGY. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF, AS YOU SAY, GASOLINE AND CARS. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF OIL. THEY WANT TO GET OF EFFICIENT, EFFICIENT HEATING. ENVIRONMENTALLY, WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS KILLING OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY OUR COUNTRY . BUT THE INFLATION IS THE THING THAT'S HURTING THE BLACK WORKER, THE BLACK POPULATION AND EVERY OTHER POPULATION WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. INFLATION, THE WORST IT'S BEEN, I THINK, IN OVER 100 YEARS. AND THEY ARE FACT CHECK IT. THEY'LL SAY IT'S ONLY 58, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. DON'T ADD ALL THE NUMBERS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE REALLY BAD NUMBERS. AND YOU CAN CHECK TOO. BUT INFLATION, HARRIS, IS ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, YES, THE PRESIDENT CAN I ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION? YES. ALSO IMPACTING BLACKS. AND THAT'S VERY CLEAR NOW BECAUSE I'M SORRY, IT'S VERY. >> I HEAR YOU. OKAY. I'M SO SORRY, MARTHA. SOMEONE FROM ILLINOIS, AN UNARMED BLACK WOMAN, WAS SHOT THE OTHER DAY IN HER HOME BY A DEPUTY SHERIFF. THE DEPUTY HAS SINCE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. YOU'VE SAID POLICE WOULD GET IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION IF YOU WIN. >> WHY SHOULD SOMEONE LIKE THAT OFFICER HAVE IMMUNITY, IN YOUR OPINION? IMMUNITY. IMMUNITY? I DON'T THE EXACT CASE, BUT I SAW SOMETHING AND IT DIDN'T LOOK. IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD TO ME. IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD TO ME. ARE YOU TALKING WITH THE WATER? RIGHT? YEAH, WELL, I MEAN, UNIONS ARE NOT BACKING THIS PERSON EITHER, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE CHARGING THE OFFICER. I GUESS THEY'RE CHARGING THE OFFICER. SO WHY SHOULD HE RECEIVED IMMUNITY? WELL, HE MIGHT NOT. I MEAN, IT DEPENDS. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS. I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE MUCH DIFFERENT CASES THAN THAT. WE NEED PEOPLE TO PROTECT OURSELVES. BY THE WAY, IN CHICAGO, AS AN EXAMPLE, A FEW WEEKS AGO, ON JULY 4TH WEEKEND, THEY HAD 117 SHOOTINGS AND 17 DEATHS. NOBODY WANTS THAT. NOBODY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OUR POLICE OFFICERS HAVE THE AND DIGNITY BACK. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, I SAW SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD TO ME. I DIDN'T LIKE IT. I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL. SO CAN YOU GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC BACK TO THE IMMUNITY QUESTION? WHO WOULD MAKE THOSE? TAKE THOSE? WELL, I THINK FOR THE MOST PART FOR THE MOST PART, PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED BY THEIR UNIONS, THEIR POLICE UNIONS OR BY THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. BUT I'M SAYING IF IF I FELT OR IF IF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD FEEL THAT SOMEBODY WAS BEING UNFAIRLY PROSECUTED BECAUSE THE PERSON DID A GOOD JOB, MAYBE WITH CRIME OR MADE A MISTAKE, AN INNOCENT MISTAKE, THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A BAD PERSON AND MAKING INNOCENT MISTAKE. BUT IF SOMEBODY MADE AN INNOCENT MISTAKE, I WANT TO HELP THAT PERSON. >> WHAT WOULD THOSE EXCEPTIONS BE? WHAT WHAT WOULD DETERMINE? YOU GO AFTER SOMEBODY AND IT'S A VERY CLOSE CALL AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS. >> AND, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THE POLICEMAN'S LIFE. AND WOMAN IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE LESS THAN A SECOND TO MAKE IT, YOU KNOW, LIFE AND DEATH DECISION AND SOMETIMES VERY BAD DECISIONS ARE THEY'RE NOT MADE FROM AN EVIL STANDPOINT, BUT THEY'RE MADE THE STANDPOINT OF THEY MADE A MISTAKE. >> SO I WANT TO FOLLOW REALLY QUICKLY. YOU KNOW, I FIND IT INTERESTING BECAUSE DO TALK ABOUT REINING IN PROSECUTORS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROSECUTORS THAT ARE PROSECUTING YOU. WHY DOES THAT SKEPTICISM APPLY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT? WELL, I'VE BEEN PROSECUTOR BECAUSE I'M A POLITICAL OPPONENT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE WEAPONIZED OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'VE BEEN I JUST WON THE BIG CASE IN FLORIDA. EVERYONE SAID THAT WAS THE BIGGEST THAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT CASE. AND I JUST WANTED. NOW, BIDEN HAS A SIMILAR CASE, EXCEPT MUCH WORSE. I WAS PROTECTED UNDER THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. BIDEN WASN'T BECAUSE HE WASN'T PRESIDENT AT THE TIME, AND HE HAD 50 YEARS WORTH OF DOCUMENTS AND THEY RULED THAT HE WAS INCOMPETENT AND THEREFORE HE SHOULDN'T STAND TRIAL. AND I SAID, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? HE'S INCOMPETENT. AND HE CAN'T STAND TRIAL, AND YET HE CAN BE PRESIDENT. ISN'T THAT MR. PRESIDENT? THEY RELEASED HIM ON THE BASIS THAT HE WAS INCOMPETENT. THEY SAID HE HAD NO MEMORY AND HE WAS A NICE OLD GUY, BUT HE HAD NO MEMORY AND THEREFORE WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE HIM. I WON THE CASE AND GOT VERY LITTLE PUBLICITY. I DIDN'T NOTICE ABC DOING ANY PUBLICITY ON IT. GEORGE. AFTER I HAD TO MOVE OVER, I DIDN'T DO ANY PUBLICITY ON IT AT ALL. I WON THE CASE. THE BIGGEST CASE IN THIS. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON A POLITICAL OPPONENT. I HAVE ANOTHER ONE WHERE I HAVE AN IDOL JUDGE. WE HAVE YOU FOR A LIMITED TIME . I'D LOVE TO MOVE ON TO DIFFERENT. EXCUSE YOU. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HELD ME UP FOR 35 MINUTES. >> SO YOU UNDERSTAND, IF WE CAN MOVE ON NOW TO THE STATE OF THE RACE OR I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN. SENATOR J.D. VANCE IS YOUR RUNNING MATE. HE'S HAD A LOT OF CONTROVERSY LATELY, AND I WANT TO READ YOU A FEW THINGS THAT HE HAS SAID IN THE PAST. HE SAID THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING THE COUNTRY ARE A BUNCH OF CHILDLESS CAT LADIES WHO ARE MISERABLE AT THEIR OWN LIVES AND THE CHOICES THEY'VE MADE. AND SO THEY DON'T THEY WANT TO MAKE REST OF THE COUNTRY MISERABLE, TOO. HE'S NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE A PARENT. HE'S ATTACKING WHAT HE SAYS ARE THE CHOICES PEOPLE ARE MAKING TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN. >> DID YOU KNOW THAT HE THESE VIEWS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN BEFORE YOU PICKED TO BE YOUR RUNNING MATE AND DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM? >> NO. I KNOW THIS. HE IS VERY FAMILY ORIENTED AND HE THINKS FAMILIES ARE A GREAT THING. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE THINKS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FAMILY ,NOT I KNOW PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES. I KNOW PEOPLE WITH GREAT FAMILIES. I KNOW PEOPLE WITH VERY TROUBLED FAMILIES. AND I ALSO KNOW PEOPLE WITH NO FAMILIES. THEY DIDN'T MEET THE RIGHT PERSON. THINGS HAPPEN. YOU GO THROUGH LIFE. YOU DON'T MEET THE RIGHT, NOT JUST TALKING TO FAMILIES HERE. >> AND SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE CHILDREN TO GET VOTES TO DO. I'M JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. I THINK, I SPEAK FOR HIM, TOO. HE STRONGLY BELIEVES IN FAMILY . BUT I KNOW PEOPLE WITH GREAT FAMILIES. I KNOW PEOPLE WITH NOT GREAT FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE A FAMILY. AND THE PEOPLE WITHOUT THE FAMILY FAR BETTER THAN SUPERIOR IN MANY CASES. OKAY. HE'S NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THAT HE THINKS THE EXPERIENCE IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING. IT'S A VERY GOOD THING. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IF YOU GROW UP AND YOU GROW OLD AND YOU DON'T MEET SOMEBODY THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO ME. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD. THAT THAT'S BAD THING. HE'S NOT SAYING THAT. MY INTERPRETATION. YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM ACTUALLY. BUT MY INTERPRETATION IS HE STRONGLY FAMILY. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FAMILY, THERE'S WRONG WITH IT. >> JUST ONE LAST POINT AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON. JUST. JUST ONE OF THE BEDROCK PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN LIFE IS ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE. >> SENATOR J.D. VANCE HAS SUGGESTED THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE VOTES THAN A PERSON WHO DOES NOT HAVE CHILDREN. I JUST TO BE CLEAR HERE, IS THAT THE POSITION OF YOUR CAMPAIGN? >> WELL, NO BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I HAVE EVER HEARD BEFORE. I CAN TELL YOU THIS RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE ILLEGAL ALIENS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND, MANY FROM PRISONS AND MANY FROM MENTAL INSTITUTIONS. THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM VOTES. I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE VOTES. THEY CAME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND THEY'VE TAKEN THEIR VOTE AWAY FROM ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN. THIS ROOM THAT HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME, THAT HAVE WORKED HARD, THAT IN MANY CASES AND YOU'LL SEE THIS HAPPENING IF I'M NOT ELECTED, GOING TO SEE THAT I AM, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEM, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HAPPENING A LONG TIME. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE PEOPLE IN THIS AND PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM ARE GOING TO BE LOSING THEIR JOBS THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME INTO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. >> MR. PRESIDENT. CAN WE STAY WITH JUST KIND OF THE STATE OF THE RACE RIGHT NOW? BECAUSE I FELT LIKE THAT VICE QUESTION CANDIDATE CANDIDATE QUESTION WAS RIGHT IN THERE WITH THAT. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT J.D. VANCE FOR A LITTLE BIT. HE'S HAD SOME STUMBLES OUT OF THE GATE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE HEARING WHAT WE HEAR IS REPORTERS, BUT IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR HIM. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE J.D. VANCE? >> WHY NOW? WHY DID YOU CHOOSE HIM? AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING CHOSE A FAIR CANDIDATE. I'LL TELL YOU WHY I CHOSE HIM, BECAUSE HE'S A VERY STRONG BELIEVER IN WORK AND THE WORKING MAN AND WOMAN, AND ESPECIALLY THE WORKING MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAVE BEEN TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANY OF THEM, MANY OF THEM IN THIS ROOM. BUT YOU HAVE OF THOSE PEOPLE, THEY WERE TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY. THEY WORKED VERY HARD. THEY WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY. HE WROTE THE BOOK THAT BECAME A BESTSELLER. THE MOVIE BECAME A SMASH HIT. HE'S A VERY SMART GUY WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A FAMILY THAT HAS CONTACTS LIKE A FATHER THAT WAS WELL CONNECTED. HE GOT INTO YALE LAW SCHOOL. HE GRADUATED IN TWO YEARS FROM OHIO STATE, SUMMA CUM LAUDE. HE I MEAN, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW, HIS CAREER HAS BEEN AN AMAZING HE STARTED OFF AT A LEVEL WITH A DIFFICULT FAMILY SITUATION, VERY DIFFICULT WITH MOTHER AND THE FATHER AND EVERYTHING ELSE. HE ENDS UP GOING THE YALE LAW SCHOOL WAS ONE OF THE TOP STUDENTS, BECAME THE HEAD OF THE LAW JOURNAL. I MEAN, THAT'S AN AMAZING THING. HE WENT HE'S A FOUR YEAR. HE WAS IN THE MILITARY WITH GREAT DISTINCTION FOR FOUR YEARS, GOT OUT, WENT INTO BUSINESS BECAME SUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS, ACTUALLY DID, PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND OTHER THINGS. AND I YOU I HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THAT. I MEAN, HE'S SOMEBODY THAT WAS BORN A ROUGH SITUATION. MOST OF THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT SITUATION. THIS WAS VERY WELL DOCUMENTED IN HIS BOOK. AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT SOMEBODY THAT CAN GET INTO YALE AND BECOME ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN YALE THAT MEETS A YOUNG WOMAN AT YALE WHO WAS ALSO OUTSTANDING. AND THEY GET MARRIED. THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. BUT HE HAD A, YOU KNOW HE'S MADE HIMSELF AN AMAZING LIFE. HE THEN GETS GOES TO OHIO, LIVES IN OHIO, AND HE HAD MY ENDORSEMENT. THAT HELPED. BUT HE WINS THE SENATE HE BECOMES A UNITED STATES SENATOR. SO HE IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR. SO AND SO. HARRIS, LIKE I RESPECT YOU FOR YOUR SUCCESS. I RESPECT PEOPLE FOR THEIR SUCCESS. THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS BECAUSE THE LAST TIME YOU AND I SAT AND TALKED WAS THE DAY THAT YOU WERE SHOT. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR MUCH OF THAT DAY. YOU LEFT TO GO TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS NEXT. AND TWO DAYS AFTER THAT, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOUR MICROPHONE. I KNOW IT IS REALLY HARD. I MEAN, IT'S JUST I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY. >> THE CLOSER I CAN UNDERSTAND. HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND. HARRIS, I HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE, THE MIKES ARE REALLY IN LOUSY SHAPE, BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. >> SO WHAT I WANTED TO SAY, THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE, YOU SAID SOME WORDS THAT WERE PROPHETIC BECAUSE I ASKED YOU WHO YOU WANTED TO CHOOSE FOR VICE PRESIDENT, AND YOU SAID NORMALLY IT REALLY WOULDN'T MATTER WHAT THEY WOULD. YOU CHOOSE SOMEBODY THAT YOU THINK HAS A FUTURE THAT OF THING. BUT YOU SAID THESE WORDS THREE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE AN ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION ON YOUR. >> YOU TOLD ME THAT BAD THINGS HAPPEN. HARRIS AND THAT'S WHY THIS DECISION IS IMPORTANT THIS TIME. BAD THINGS HAPPEN. YOU SAID IT TWICE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT J.D. VANCE, IS HE READY ON DAY ONE? DOES HE WANT READY ON DAY ONE? >> IF HE HAS TO BE. I'VE ALWAYS HAD GREAT FOR HIM AND FOR THE OTHER CANDIDATES. BUT I WILL SAY THIS AND I THINK THIS IS WELL, HISTORICALLY, THE VICE PRESIDENT, IN TERMS OF THE ELECTION DOES NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT. I MEAN, VIRTUALLY NO IMPACT. YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE DAYS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF COMMOTION AS TO WHO LIKE YOU'RE HAVING ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, WHO IT'S GOING TO BE, AND THEN THAT DIES. AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL PICK. VIRTUALLY NEVER HAS IT MATTERED. MAYBE LYNDON JOHNSON MATTERED FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT FOR WHAT REASONS, BUT FOR POLITICAL REASONS. OTHER POLITICAL REASONS. BUT HISTORICALLY, THE CHOICE OF A VICE PRESIDENT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. YOU'RE VOTING FOR THE PRESIDENT ,AND YOU CAN HAVE A VICE PRESIDENT WHO IS OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. AND I THINK JJ IS. I THINK THAT ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN. BUT -- BUT YOU'RE NOT VOTING THAT WAY. YOU'RE VOTING THE PRESIDENT. YOU'RE VOTING FOR ME. IF YOU LIKE ME, I'M GOING TO WIN. IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN. I'M GOING TO GET MY J.D. VANCE QUESTION AND J.D. VANCE. I'M GOING TO GET MY J.D. VANCE QUESTION AND TO YOUR POINT AND TO RACHEL'S POINT, HE, YOU KNOW, HAS A LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT CHILDLESS WOMEN LIKE MYSELF OR DIVORCED PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF. DO YOU THINK? >> WELL, I MEAN, MY POINT IS THAT WAS IN A FRIENDLY MANNER. >> MY POINT IS, DO YOU THINK THE PARTY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GETTING LITTLE BIT TOO JUDGY ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES? >> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ABORTION OR WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT J.D. VANCE IS SAYING? I DON'T THINK. LOOK, I THINK THAT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS REALLY THE ONE THAT HAS THE PROBLEM. I THINK THEY'RE RADICAL ON ABORTION BECAUSE THEY ARE ALLOWING ABORTION IN THE NINTH MONTH. THEY'RE ALLOWING I THINK THEY'RE ALLOWING THE DEATH OF A BABY AFTER THE BABY IS BORN BASED ON. SIR, THAT'S THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, STATE BASED THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. THEY'RE ALLOWING A DEATH TO TAKE THE BABY AFTER ITS BORN THERE, ALLOWING ABORTIONS IN THE EIGHTH AND NINTH MONTH. WELL, DEMOCRATS HAVE DENIED I THINK THEY'RE WRONG. AND I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ACTUALLY MUCH LESS. I THINK I'VE MADE THEM MUCH LESS RADICAL, PERHAPS, BUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS BRINGING IT BACK TO THE STATES WHERE EVERYBODY WANTED IT DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVE, EVERYBODY, ABORTION BROUGHT BACK. THEY DIDN'T WANT ROE V. WADE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY WANTED IT. EVERYBODY BUT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OPPOSE IS ROE V WADE BEING OVERTURNED. THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE VOTING. IT BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE STATES. NOW, I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN THE THREE EXCEPTIONS, RONALD REAGAN BELIEVE WITH  LIFE OF THE MOTHER. I DO THINK MOST PEOPLE DO. I THINK MOST REPUBLICANS DO ALSO. BUT IF TAKE A LOOK RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE DOING IT'S AN AMAZING THING OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S IN STATES AND PEOPLE ARE VOTING. AND I WILL SAY OHIO IS LET'S LET'S CALL IT A MORE LIBERAL VERSION HAS BEEN APPROVED. KANSAS THE SAME THING A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT THE PEOPLE NOW VOTING AND IT'S TAKING THIS ISSUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR 52 YEARS AND IT'S TORN OUR COUNTRY APART AND IT'S GIVING IT TO THE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON AND THEY'RE VOTING. MANY STATES HAVE ALREADY VOTED. OTHERS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF VOTING AND IT'S BRINGING IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. AND IT'S NOT AT ALL RADICAL. AND AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN THE THREE EXCEPTIONS. MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THE THREE EXCEPTION. MOST REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN THE EXCEPTIONS, BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE AN ABORTION IN THE NINTH MONTH OR THE EIGHTH MONTH. ALMOST EVERYBODY AGREES TO THAT ,AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE, IN THE CASE OF THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA THE FORMER GOVERNOR AND MY DAD, WHO SAID WE SET THE BABY ASIDE AND THEN WE DECIDE WHAT TO DO, WHAT DO WE DO? WE EXECUTE THE BABY. THAT'S A RADICAL HORROR PROPOSITION. AND SOME PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE WANT THAT DON'T WANT IT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T. THANK YOU. CAN I JUST HAVE IT REALLY QUICKLY? ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT YOU BROUGHT UP HEALTH HARRIS. YOU'RE AN ACTIVE MAN. YOU WE SEE YOU GOLFING ALL THE TIME. >> BUT IF IF YOU WIN, YOU'LL STILL BE PRESIDENT AT 82, WHICH IS OLDER THAN BIDEN IS RIGHT NOW, BUT NOT MENTALLY. >> LOOK, MENTALLY. >> OKAY, LOOK, HERE'S THE QUESTION. YOU SHOT. HE SHOT BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD YOU CAN SAY MOST PEOPLE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THAT ARE IN GREAT SHAPE. SOME OF OUR GREATEST LEADERS YOU LOOK AT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WORLD HISTORY, THE GREATEST LEADERS, SOME OF THE GREATEST LEADERS IN THE WORLD WERE IN THEIR EIGHTIES. BUT HERE'S THE QUESTION WOULD YOU CONSIDER STEPPING DOWN IF YOU FELT YOUR HEALTH WAS DECLINING OR WOULD YOU? ABSOLUTELY. AND WOULD I THINK I'D KNOW. HOW WOULD YOU MAKE THAT DECISION? I THINK I'D KNOW. LOOK, IF I CAME ON TO A STAGE LIKE THIS AND I GOT TREATED SO RUDELY AS THIS WOMAN, OH, MY GOODNESS. AND I'M FINE WITH IT BECAUSE. SHE IT DOES IT SHE WAS VERY RUDE, SIR. VERY RUDE. THAT WAS A NASTY THAT WASN'T A QUESTION. SHE ASKED THE QUESTION. SHE GAVE A STATEMENT THAT WASN'T I ACTUALLY YOU YOU SAID YOU WOULD. >> YOU WOULD IF I THOUGHT THAT I WAS FAILING IN SOME WAY. I WANT PEOPLE TO BE UP. I'LL GO A STEP FURTHER. I WANT ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, TAKE AN APTITUDE TEST AND TAKE A COGNITIVE TEST. I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND I TOOK TWO OF THEM AND I, I JUST I TOOK TWO OF THEM. BUT LET ME ASK. YEAH. YEAH. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND I DON'T MEAN BECAUSE THEY'RE 75 OR 85. I THINK ANYBODY I'D LIKE TO DO IT. PEOPLE SAY IT'S NOT CONSTITUTIONAL. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING PASSED WHERE YOU CAN DO IT. I THINK WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW. I MEAN, I'VE WATCHED WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THIS GENTLEMAN AND OUR COUNTRY IS A MESS. WE HAVE INFLATION, WE HAVE THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FALLING IN. WE HAVE AFGHANISTAN, WHICH WAS THE WORST, MOST EMBARRASSING IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WHAT HE HAS DONE TO OUR COUNTRY AND HER TO WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO OUR COUNTRY. SHE HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE VICE PRESIDENT. >> SHE'S CONSIDERED THE WORST VICE PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR VIEW. BUT WOULD YOU CONSIDER TAKING THE COGNITIVE TEST? MR. PRESIDENT WOULD LOOK AND MAKE IT PUBLIC? WELL, I I'VE ALREADY TAKEN TWO OF THEM, BUT I'LL DO IT AGAIN. I SAID YES. HOW ARE YOU INTEND? I SUGGESTED HARRIS THAT LET'S TAKE ONE. I SAID, JOE AND I WILL AND TAKE A COGNITIVE TEST. NOW I DO IT WITH HER TO I WOULD DO IT WITH HER ALSO. YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE FELT HER LOGS AND SHE DIDN'T PASS HER LOG JAM, SO MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T PASS THE COGNITIVE TEST. MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD HAVE JUST GIVEN YOU THE FACT TO BE CLEAR, YOU DON'T THINK YOU INTEND TO PASS HER BAR EXAM AND SHE DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD PASS IT AND DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE A PASS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. MAYBE SHE PASSED IT. SHE DID PASS IT. THERE'S A MAN OVER HERE IN THE BACK. MR. PRESIDENT, WOULD LOVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT JANUARY 6. YOU CALLED YOURSELF THE CANDIDATE OF LAW AND ORDER. >> WHEN TIME MAGAZINE ASKED YOU IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER PARDONING ALL THE RIOTERS, YOU SAID? YES, ABSOLUTELY. YOU CALLED THEM PATRIOTS. 140 POLICE OFFICERS WERE ASSAULTED THAT DAY. THEIR INJURIES INCLUDED BROKEN . AT LEAST ONE OFFICER LOST AN EYE. ONE HAD TWO CRACKED RIBS, TWO SMASHED SPINAL DISCS. ANOTHER HAD A STROKE. WERE THE PEOPLE WHO ASSAULTED THOSE 140 OFFICERS, INCLUDING THOSE I JUST MENTIONED, PATRIOTS WHO DESERVE. >> WELL, LET ME BRING IT BACK TO MODERN DAY LIKE ABOUT FIVE DAYS AGO, WE HAD AN ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL, HORRIBLE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. YOU SAW THE PEOPLE THAT WERE PROTESTING AND SPRAYING THESE INCREDIBLE MONUMENTS, BELLS LINES, ALL THESE MAGNIFICENT LIMESTONE AND GRANITE WITH RED PAINT, RED SPRAY PAINT THAT WILL NEVER ACTUALLY COME OFF, ESPECIALLY IN THE LIMESTONE. IT WILL NEVER I'M A BUILDER. I KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF. IT'LL NEVER YOU'LL SEE IT IN A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW. THEY VICIOUSLY ATTACKED OUR GOVERNMENT. THEY FOUGHT WITH POLICE, THEY FOUGHT WITH THEM MUCH MORE OPENLY THAN I SAW ON JANUARY SIX. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THOSE PEOPLE? WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE PEOPLE IN PORTLAND THAT DESTROYED MY IS ON THEM. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? MY PRICE ON THE RIOTERS WHO ASSAULTED OFFICERS. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. OH, ABSOLUTELY. I WOULD WOULD PARDON THEM IF THEY WERE INNOCENT. I WOULD PART THEM. THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED THE WAY THE SUPREME COURT JUST UNDER. WELL, THEY WERE CONVICTED BY A VERY A VERY TOUGH SYSTEM WERE. HOW COME THE PEOPLE THAT TRIED TO BURN DOWN MINNEAPOLIS, HOW COME THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK OVER LARGE PERCENTAGE OF SEATTLE, HOW COME NOTHING HAPPENED TO THEM? HOW COME THE PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE THAT WERE CELEBRATING, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BLACKFELLAS DRAGGING THEM DOWN THE STAIRS THERE. THEY. >> HAVE YOU SEEN THAT VIDEO, SIR?

THEY WERE DESECRATING OUR MONUMENTS IN WASHINGTON, DC. FIVE DAYS AGO AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO THEM. AND YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE. THAT'S WHY THEY WENT AFTER ME AS A POLITICAL OPPONENT, BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY COULDN'T WIN WITHOUT THAT. AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN OUR CASES AND WE'RE GOING TO BE VINDICATED. BUT I HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THAT AND MONEY. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT AFTER ELECTION. THEY WANT, ALTHOUGH IN MY CASE, I THINK THEY PROBABLY WILL, BECAUSE THE HATRED PRETTY DEEP. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, THEY WENT AFTER ME AS A POLITICAL OPPONENT. THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY BEFORE. AND IT'S SUCH A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PRECEDENT. >> WHAT DID YOU DO ON DAY ONE IF YOU WIN?
