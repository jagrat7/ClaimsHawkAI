krbTeO0Lo00_4.0,most importantly let me say a special thanks to the gigantic Grassroots movement of volunteers who will power the faith and freedom Coalition and I know they're going to be very much involved during the election period it used to be one day now it's you know two months it used to start like election day meant election day now it means you know two and a half months before the election begins it starts but it starts actually uh pretty much on September 6th that's North Carolina Pennsylvania's think of that so September 6 and Pennsylvania's uh September 22nd and we have to get out there we have to vote we have to make sure everything's honest and you keep your eyes open you know you're you're the police in a way you can be you can police your vote a lot of people don't know that just make sure that vote counts we have to make sure it counts because if I knew that there was not going to be corruption if I knew that everything would be on hble and honest
krbTeO0Lo00_5.0,"as it should be I'd stop campaigning right now we have this thing won I would immediately stop campaigning I'd go and relax I'd call up the big rally we have in Philadelphia tonight and say it's not necessary don't worry about everyone go home and relax no organization does more you are truly and I mean this indispensable this is a great group of people and and you're Warriors in the truest sense and you know what we have to do because we're not going to have a country left if we don't do it it's for sure this year you will knock on 10 million doors reach 18 million Christian voters and register 1 million new voters across 130,000 churches and I hope you can put the lock boxes in the churches because that's what you should be doing you should have lock boxes you know these boxes that they cheat with so badly uh you should put them in in your churches because you"
krbTeO0Lo00_6.0,know the evangelicals and the Christians they don't vote as much as they should I don't know if you know that you know they go to church every Sunday but they don't vote and we have to make sure they vote just this time because all you have to do is this time you don't have to worry about it because we're going to straighten it out very fast just this time go vote but you know they have a uh it's very interesting the NRA gave me a very big endorsement and uh we were talking about it and gun owners don't vote very much I mean I'm saying this is just statistically we have to get people that own guns have to go and vote you own a rifle you want to keep your rifle you better go vote because the the Second Amendment is under siege and you have to vote and who would have known that I think it's sort of a protest you're so angry about what's happening but this is over years gun owners don't vote much meaning you know some vote but not relatively speaking not that much and uh
krbTeO0Lo00_7.0,Christians go to church but they don't vote that much do you know the power you have if you would vote it wouldn't even be so you got to get out of vote just this time I don't care in four years you don't have to vote okay in four years don't vote I don't care but that time but we'll have it all straighten out so it'll be much different of course then they'll come in again and they'll ruin it we'll have to do this all over again then we'll come back say you have to go vote working side by side we're going to defeat crooked Joe Biden we're going to defend our values and we're going to make America great again and this will be the most important election in the history of our country I believe that I used to say it 2016 we had a border that was bad but the Border was bad but it was like I call it peanuts peanuts compared to what we have now that was like a great border if we had that border now it would be like great it was uh it was really bad but it was is a just a tiny fraction of
krbTeO0Lo00_8.0,what it is now now it's the worst it's ever been I I would say it's the worst border anywhere of any country anywhere in the world at any time in less than four years Joe Biden has obliterated the borders of the United States we don't have borders we don't have borders we don't have elections that are proper we don't have anything and you know what we want with elections we want paper ballots same day voting voter ID and we want to ensure that people are citizens little thing a little thing like let's make sure you're a citizen right you know they're bringing these people in they're trying to get these people registered to vote they don't speak a word of English most of them and they come from all over the world that's what they're doing I said there was only a few things it could could it be they're stupid well they're not stupid nobody could cheat that well if they were stupid they're not stupid then the other is they hate our country that could be that could be but the third thing is they want to register people to vote
krbTeO0Lo00_9.0,that's I think what they really have in mind so we have to be very careful and that's where Michael wattley will do the job that's where Susie WS who's here right now she's fantastic and she'll do the job and Lara will do the job Lara chump who's fantastic she's fantastic but crooked Jill wrecked our economy with brutal inflation and2 trillion doll deficits did you hear our deficit is going to be $2 trillion doll this year two trillion his weakness failure and incompetence have set the world on fire he is a threat to democracy by the way just by being so incompetent he's a threat to democracy his Marxist Administration is pushing radical gender ideology into every school and I'm sure this group is not particularly happy with that and crooked Joe has demonstrated an amazing ability to you know he's just to demolish the rule of law by arresting political opponents diss Christians pro-life activists like
krbTeO0Lo00_10.0,a third world dictator would do it's a disgrace what's happened to our country in such a short period of time three and a half years what's happened to our country it's not even believable our one chance to save America from these leftwing fascists is less than it's now four months can you believe it I've been saying seven six five it's now we're in between four and five months from now November 5th going to go down as the most important day in the history history of our country I'm telling you because we're not going to have I hope we can get there without ending in a world war you know Russia Russia's got submarines now very nicely in Cuba you know where Cuba is is about two feet away from Florida no they've got chips there and they're talking about you know going after Russia in Ukraine and giving them authorization to go after Russia you know where's this thing going to and I've said it I will get that war s if there's anything left if there's
krbTeO0Lo00_11.0,anything left I'll get it Sol as President elect before I ever get into the White House but we need Christian voters to turn out in the largest numbers ever to tell crooked Joe Biden Joe The Apprentice Joe you're fired you're fired Joe get out of here Joe you're no good you've been the worst president ever you fired Joe get  out no worst president in the history of our country as you know the radical left is trying to shame Christians Silence You demoralize you and they want to keep you out of politics they don't want you to vote that's why you have to vote they're counting on you not because if you vote no we cannot lose they don't want you to vote but Christians cannot afford to sit on the sidelines if Joe Biden gets back in Christianity will not be safe in a nation with no borders no laws no Freedom no future they're not going to be safe you're not going to be safe as a
krbTeO0Lo00_12.0,person and your religion certainly will be I think in tatters you want to know the truth I think in tatters you see what they're doing and and I don't know it's less a little bit less to do with this room but we all care what's going on with Catholics they are being persecuted Catholics what is that all about by this guy this guy this man that has no idea what the hell is happening and by the way I don't believe it is him I think it's the people that surround him the fascist communist the young very smart vicious people because I don't think he knows he's alive if you want to know the truth Okay the reason the radical left will always come after religious Believers is simple because they know that our Allegiance is not to them our Allegiance is not to them our Allegiance is to our country and our Allegiance is to our creator and we do not not answer to the
krbTeO0Lo00_13.0,bureaucrats in Washington we answer to God in heaven you're not even allowed to say that anymore today if you say that they want to arrest you if you say that they want to arrest you who likes the Ten Commandments by the way going up in the schools they think it's such a bad thing I said has anyone read thee Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt I mean has anybody read this incredible stuff it's just incredible they don't want it to go up it's uh crazy world you know a crazy world things who would who would think that somebody would want open borders where people flood in by the millions from all over the world from prisons and from mental institutions and a lot of terrorists terrorists in record numbers nobody said anything like it who would think that's good who would think that you know like a little thing it's so embarrassing even have to say it but I say it because it's a big political deal
krbTeO0Lo00_14.0,who would think that men playing in women's sports is okay who would think that I I have to say it who would think it it's all you know open borders who would think it who would think this stuff but in my first term I defended judeo Christian Heritage like no president in the history of our country and with your help I will continue to fight for our values and our civilization for four more years in the white house we're going to straighten it out we're going to straighten it out fast it's going to go fast uh the hardest thing to do is we have probably close to 20 million people that came in from all parts of the world and uh they're going to have to be uh gone they came in illegally many many people coming in from prisons and mental institutions they came in I mean from you know I say prisons and jails because there is a slight difference I say mental institutions and insane asylums uh because actually there there's more than a slight difference right whenever I say Silence of the Lamb the fake news back there they say oh he's talking about he's talking about Silence of the
krbTeO0Lo00_15.0,lab and I say the late great Hannibal Lea oh he likes Hannibal Lea no they're crazy when I imitate Joe Biden can't get off the stage I walk into a wall purposely I look at that wall oh that's that's perfect sometimes they don't have a wall you're freestanding it doesn't but I imitate him and I I you know walk into a wall and the next day they write Donald Trump could not find his way off the stage no no so I don't even do it anymore it's these are crooked people and yet with him they're trying to say that all of these horrible blunders that he's made over the last week you don't have to go back much that that he was improperly covered so they say you know in the one case he he had a fundraiser and Obama could have been more gentle in all fairness that's I think that's a dispute were in their own party because you know Obama could have been a little bit more gentle than that so instead of tugging him off the stage
krbTeO0Lo00_16.0,when you think of it right but he made it obvious but he made it obvious but you see that and then I think 39 different people had their phones up like you people you have your phones up if I did something wrong and I had one camera then another camera you know after you get 39 or so you say I guess he I guess he blew it but they said oh it was covered so and they you know like they changed it and Ai and all the stuff they didn't do that they didn't do that it was was that was the way it was they're all the same but the Press has bought into it now oh no he was fine it was the coverage was so bad by conservative they say by conservatives uh when I equated uh two people I I equated them I shouldn't mention the names but I equated Nikki Haley with Nancy palassi I equate they said oh he doesn't understand the no I understand the difference he doesn't understand the difference
krbTeO0Lo00_17.0,between Haley and Pelosi no we understand that I understand a lot of differences but anything you do the fake news will take it and turn it but with him they take bad stuff and try to make it look good with us they take genius pure genius and they try and make it look right they try and make it look bad it's the exact opposite so we actually have to work harder I told my kids it would be a lot easier if you were Democrats we have to work very much harder you know we have to run the entire e Coast to win they automatically start with like 38% they start with 38% I mean I could go into why and the percentages but I don't want to do that because I think we're going to get a lot of that 38% you want to know like people in unions not to mention it like people in unions because we have tremendous support from the Yota workers tremendous support from the teamsters and tremendous I've heard so many Teamsters Concrete in New York it's all delivered by Teamsters they do a great job but uh we're going to get we're going to have have a lot of Union support so I'm not going to say anything
krbTeO0Lo00_18.0,just think of what we've already achieved and we've done things that nobody thought possible together we stood up to the Communist Marxist and fascist to defend religious liberty like no other president has ever done and I have the wounds all over my body if I took this shirt off you'd see a beautiful beautiful person but you'd see wounds all over all over me I've taken a lot of wounds I can tell you more than I suspect any president ever you know in history and I've read I love I love this stuff but in history they say Andrew Jackson was treated the worst president Andrew he was a great General and a very good president and Abraham Lincoln was second worst now he had a civil war so you know you saw I think that was
krbTeO0Lo00_19.0,understood and now they're rewriting the books Trump was trated at the worst Andrew Jackson second and Abraham Lincoln third but I definitely took top spot I took stop and I'm honored to do it and here we are looking for more how about that I could right now be home I wouldn't be in court I wouldn't be in courts all over the land all started by crooked Joe Biden and his group of thugs we restored the conscious wrs and all of the things that we've done for doctors nurses teachers and Faith groups like The Little Sisters of the Poor we came to their defense I stopped the IRS from using the Johnson amendment to interfere with pastors freedom of speech and all religious leaders Pastor not only pastors and Joe Biden took it right away and I will give it right back we're going to give it right back you know a long time ago I learned about Johnson Amendment a long time ago they basically taken away
krbTeO0Lo00_20.0,your rights you're not allowed if you're a minister a pastor or other religious leader a rabbi if you want to say things that are political they take away your tax exemptions and they really destroy you and I put that back and now they've put it back it's like a yo-yo I'm going to put it back immediately first day I'm giving that back because we want to hear from our ministers our pastors and our rabbis and others by the way I issued guidance making clear that the right to freedom of worship does not end at the door to a public school I was the first to and I'm the only President I think to convene a meeting at the United Nations to end religious persecution worldwide the only time it's ever been done because you know what presidents that get elected and then they don't want to get involved we don't want to get involved like what I did for Israel as an example right with Jerusalem and every president for many many presidents said we're going to do
krbTeO0Lo00_21.0,that Capital going to make Jerusalem the capital they're going to move the embassy to Jerusalem and nobody did it and I understood why because once I got there I had more pressure put on me from other countries please don't do it please don't do it I did it I did something what many presidents I don't know the number but going back a long time they campaigned on it that it did it I campaigned on it and I did it I I just didn't take thank you very much that's very nice you know what I I didn't take calls for about 4 days I set up the meeting on a Monday and I didn't take calls I was away quote over the we and he'll call you back on Tuesday oh kings queens everybody he'll call you back on Tuesday and we had a press conference on Monday and I announced Jerusalem I announced that we're going to move the embassy and uh Jerusalem comes the capital something and and by
krbTeO0Lo00_22.0,the way uh that's a small one compared to what I did I got rid of the Iran nuclear deal unfortunately Biden yeah but Biden did nothing with it and Golan Heights and the Abraham Accords what I did for Israel and and interestingly this group is so unbelievably pro-israel it's amazing actually and I tell you that because in many ways you give it more support than anybody you give more support to Israel than anybody so a lot of people really appreciate that thank you very much I can use that I can use that love thank you who is a woman she sounded so nice stand up oh thank you thank you it's very nice and you have a beautiful voice too thank you when I return to the White House I will once
krbTeO0Lo00_23.0,again aggressively defend religious freedom in all of its forms it's many forms but we will defend it in every single one of its forms we will protect Christians in our schools in our military in our government and our workplaces in our hospitals and in our Public Square in my next term I will once again appoint a rock solid conservative and we we are putting in you know we put in almost 300 judges and three Supreme Court Justices to interpret the law and the Constitution as written it was being interpreted slightly different than that as you probably noticed in my first four years we totally transformed the federal bench and putting in all of these judges and nobody's ever seen anything like it actually a record Pro Constitution judges I with stod vicious attacks to pick and confirm three great Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch Brett kavanau and Amy Cony be
krbTeO0Lo00_24.0,good people too I took a lot of heat I took a lot of heat a lot of hits but we did the right thing they're great people thanks to these justices we have also achieved what the pro-life movement fought to get for 49 years and we've gotten abortion out of the federal government and back to the state the way everybody and all legal Scholars always said it should be nobody thought that would happen that's why they wanted it the whole thing was they wanted the RO way was Federal and they wanted it all back in the States where the people could vote and make their decisions it's now up to the will of the people in each state some states will be more conservative other states will be more liberal it's happening now you see the votes are all taking place and it's the way every legal scholar and just about all the Democrats and all the Republicans and conservatives and liberals they all wanted it that way and
krbTeO0Lo00_25.0,we did something that was amazing the big problem was it was caught up in the federal government but the people will decide and that's the way it should be the people are now deciding and some states are a little bit more conservative and some states are much more liberal if the radical Democratic streams get their way they will have a federal law for abortion to rip the baby out of the womb in the seventh 8th and 9th month and even execute the baby after birth they have that you know that the governor the governor think of it the governor of Virginia previous governor we have a great governor of Virginia right now but Glenn yunan is doing a great job but the previous governor of Virginia you don't want to make that very clear because he's doing great the previous was not so good but he actually made that St and we'll put the baby down after the babies we'll put that and you you'll decide what to do and there states that allow that they're the
krbTeO0Lo00_26.0,radical ones on this issue Far and Away the radical ones not us every voter has to go with your heart and do what's right but we also have to get elected because we have a lot of other things we have to get elected you have to be able to win like Ronald reag and I believe in exceptions for the life of the mother rape and incest some people do I think most people do actually but some people don't you have to go with your heart but you have to also remember you have to get elected I want to thank the six Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas Samuel Halo John Roberts Brett kaver Neil Gorsuch and Amy Cony Barrett for the wisdom and the courage they showed on this long-term very contentious issue this has been a long time it's been fought getting it back to the States puts the question where it belongs with the vote of the people and over time it will all work out it's working out right now but it's all going to work out and it's where everybody wanted it including the legal Scholars but it's where everybody wanted it to be and it's taken
krbTeO0Lo00_27.0,actually they say 49 but it's probably 51 years it's taken to get this done above all in the Republican party we will always support families babies life and uh very very important to the Republican Party by contrast Joe Biden is weaponizing the justice department to viciously persecute pro-life activists and Americans of Faith just last month the Biden doj got Paula harlo a 75-year-old woman in poor health sentenced to two years in prison for singing outside of a CL she was singing actually a beautiful voice she was singing beautifully outside of a clinic and fearing she would die in prison her husband pleaded with the judge for mercy and even asked to be thrown in prison with his wife and the judge judge responded by mocking their religion he
krbTeO0Lo00_28.0,was mocking their religion I wonder who that judge is Paul is one of many peaceful pro-lifers who Joe Biden has rounded up sometimes with SWAT teams and thrown them in jail many people are in jail over this this is just crazy we're going to get that taking care of immediately first day immediately but let's call these Brave Americans what they really are it's persecuted Christians that's what they are they're persecuted because these people are really the threat to democracy you know they have a whole thing about Donald Trump is the threat to democracy I'm the one that got us out of the wars I'm the one that defeated Isis and got us out of all these wars you know I'm the one that had the safest Border in the history of our country and now it's death and you know when you talk about the bad border you don't realize how many people are dying on the Caravans coming up they're dying because they're told you know come on up and we're going to give you education we're
krbTeO0Lo00_29.0,going to give you healthare they're destroying your Social Security your Social Security and your Medicare is being destroyed because millions of people are coming up and you're not going to have it something's going to have to happen because they are destroying Joe Biden is destroying your Social Security and many other things to reverse these monstrous abuses of power the moment I win election and we're going to win we got to win if we don't win we don't have a country we don't have a country you know I used to say it in 2016 and I meant it we were you know I thought that was the most important election in 2020 I didn't say it by the way we got many millions of votes more in 2020 than we did in 2016 we got millions and millions of usot a rigged election but we got millions of votes more I was told if you got the same number 63 million that you win we got millions and millions and that's by their count and it was a terrible thing and look at what's happened to our country and three and a half half years it's not even it's not even the same place it's
krbTeO0Lo00_30.0,not the same place I always say We're a nation in Decline We're a nation in really serious serious decline but we will rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner who's unjustly victimized by the Biden regime including Paula so we can get them out of the gulags and back to their families where they belong Paula just hold on Paula we're going to get you out of there can you imagine this is is a good woman is a religious woman and they throw her in jail I will also create a new federal task force on fighting anti-christian bias its Mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination harassment persecution against Christians in America and it's taking place at a level that nobody can believe we're like a country from a different country we're like this isn't this is not America anymore that we're living in these people are nasty they're bad they're bad but you know what we're
krbTeO0Lo00_31.0,tougher than they are we're tougher than they are but we have to we have to be smart we have to vote we have to get out and vote you cannot sit home this one day you have to get out and vote never again will the federal government be used to Target religious Believers Americans of Americans of faith and and that's all it is it's Americans of Faith are not a threat to our country Americans of Faith are the soul of our country one of the reasons we have so much crime one of the reasons we have so much crime is you don't have the faith you know you don't have people wanting to be good because they want to go to that special place they want to be good there's no reason it's like religion is it's going down at a level that nobody's seen before nobody's seen anything like it and it's really having an a tremendous effect long beyond our churches and our synagogues and our mosques it's long Beyond it's beyond everything religion
krbTeO0Lo00_32.0,is becoming less and less of a factor less and less important in our country and that's causing a lot of the chaos and a lot of the crime that you see if if they were grown up with religion they wouldn't be doing the things that they're doing because they're doing really bad bad things and we're going to get it stopped the weaponization of law enforcement is the greatest threat to freedom in America today I think and nobody knows it better than me look at the way I've been weaponized I mean they've weaponized me at a level that the late great Al Capone right he's a I tell it all the time Scarface he he didn't go through what I went through of course they were afraid to do it they were afraid to do it they said let's leave him alone wait he would take that gentleman that handsome gentleman right there you'd have to dinner if Al if alons Capone didn't like him your family would never see you again sir they'd say what happened happened to him he's a part of a foundation under a nice
krbTeO0Lo00_33.0,highrise that's going up someplace I got indicted more than him sir for nothing for no crimes even the scholars all of the scholars they said well there is no crime here there's no crime it's it's a terrible thing these are sick people these are horrible people remember this the reason Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us is that they know we the only ones who can stop them and that's true all of their persecution is only happening because I am running for president and leading very big in the polls but since the show trial in New York that horrible horrible trial so many corrupt things happened in that trial and I think they're seeing it the people are seeing it because we have the strongest poll numbers we've ever had and I mean that goes back a long time now and uh the po the fundraising is at
krbTeO0Lo00_34.0,levels that I don't think anybody has ever seen before so there's a lot of great a lot of great things and I don't know if you saw last night in the new Ras mus poll we're leading Biden by numbers that uh people haven't led by before Biden is 10 points down National that's nationally and we're doing even better in the swing States the radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024 we're not going to allow it and every time the radical left Democrats marxists Communists and fascists and that's exactly what they are they're fascists indict me I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you thank you very much everybody I appreciate
krbTeO0Lo00_35.0,but I am I'm being indicted for you never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom they want to silence me because I will never let them silence you and in the end they're not after me they're after you I just happen to be very proudly standing in their way I am in their way and I always will be in their  way from the very first day that we take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden and his thugs I believe we're going to have four of the greatest years in the history of our country it's going to happen fast within moments of taking the oath of office I will seal the Border Stop The Invasion and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens back home where they belong they belong back home  US

krbTeO0Lo00_44.0,you can just imagine but this is a transition they've done a couple of transitions these people are they don't they're sick they're sick as president I will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare I kept that promise for four straight years and I will keep it again by contrast Joe Biden has cut Medicare Advantage payments you don't even know this for two straight years a total betrayal of seniors senior citizens he's cut your advantage payments for two years and nobody knows it and the seniors have to get on board because I'll tell you what they're being treated badly the military is being treated badly our vets are being treated the worst of all how about our vets they're laying in streets you know I had the highest approval rating for a president ever with the Veterans Administration now it's one of the low lest what I did was incredible like no long Waits if you
krbTeO0Lo00_45.0,"have to wait a long time you go get a private doctor we pay for it people were waiting 3 four months to get people were becoming terminally ill waiting also firing civil service and other workers that were sadists and Crooks but they were sadus they were beating up our soldiers in their not prime time in prime time they wouldn't be able to do it they get their ass handed to them right but they were not doing it in think of it they were not uh uh they were not treating our soldiers right and I got it and you couldn't fire them because under civil service was you cannot fire anybody they had one in Arizona they caught him stealing $400,000 they caught him called he admitted everything they couldn't fire him they could do everything but they couldn't fire him stole $400,000 but they were beating up or so they were sadists and I got the right to fire through Congress it had to go through Congress both of them had to go through Congress Joyce Choice had to go through Congress so we got them Choice"
krbTeO0Lo00_46.0,all right we and I'll tell you the number of people that were saved I got the highest rating ever 92% think of this so now it's down to 40% they ended all of this stuff why would they end it they hate our country and they hate our military they hate our veterans they hate our soldiers Biden and they made up a story about me with suckers and losers they made up the story about me looking down at graves saying sucker they make it up suckers and losers who would surrounded by military people there's nobody that's stupid enough to make that statement think of it and I was President I would have said that would have been uh Justified for somebody to start taking swings at me as president but they made it up it's a phrase that was totally made up by a third rate magazine that's going out of business losing a fortune I think it was the Atlantic a magazine that nobody reads they got lucky they got some sucker to
krbTeO0Lo00_47.0,fund it for a little while some stupid sucker her husband's looking down her former husband is looking down he's saying you dumb I should have never she took his money and she said the Atlantic magazine let's let's waste millions of dollars but no they made it up and you know you say it's not true but does 10% 5% of military people believe it this is what we have to live with it's horrible who would say it just think of it who would say that about even if you hated the military you wouldn't say it and you wouldn't certainly say it to military people so just just just from a common standpoint but that thing's haunted me for three years for three years I'll never forget I walk out of a big rally everything was great it was unbelievable and some of the fake news over there one of them so sir did you call the the dead the dead military suckers and before I even responded I said here we go cuz who would do such a thing and I'm
krbTeO0Lo00_48.0,the exact I rebuilt our military I was better than any president ever to our amican they'll say anything just like they try and now say with Biden with cheap fakes or whatever they call just what they they made up a name they're saying he was perfect all these things when he sat down because of he had obviously a problem in Normandy do you think do you think that mcon was impressed macron's An Elegant guy smart he's at the top of his game I don't think he was too impressed but just like the other day as I said with Obama or any one of the other times oh it was fake reporting by the conservative media it wasn't fake reporting it was it was just there it was just there but they made up a suckers and losers statement so terrible and my stupid people when I wanted to refute it they said sir
krbTeO0Lo00_49.0,don't dignify it with a refle refal or refle what the hell word would that be refal what you say he didn't know refal or refal but they don't know either sir it should not be dignified sir I said well I got to fight that that's a the worst thing you could probably say to me would be that he said sir it's going nowhere 3 years later it still simmers and you know what anybody in the mil oh now I fight I talk about it all the time because it doesn't make sense nobody could say a thing like you can't even if you hated the military you couldn't say that because it would be it would actually be dangerous it would be it would be so bad nobody would say that uh and uh so now I speak about it all the time because these people are liars they make it up it's now on top of that you have ai on top of that you now have ai to go along with that so it's a it's sort of a dangerous world out there on
krbTeO0Lo00_50.0,"day one we will throw out bomic and replace it with Magics quickly under Biden the economy is in Ruins inflation has costed the typical family $288,000 think of that the inflation is killing people they make the same amount of money or even if they made more it doesn't matter inflation is destroying them they can't buy anything anymore I will end I always say you know I I sort of have this little thing I shouldn't show it maybe I should save it for the debate okay look I'll save it I'm going to do this because this is private there's only about 400 press back there look inflation this is what it does to you this is Tic Tac now this is Tic Tac see it used to be"
krbTeO0Lo00_51.0,that that's what inflation that's what inflation has done that's what inflation has done glad everybody in this room has good eyes but I will end the Biden inflation Nightmare and we will end it very quickly I will stop Biden's trillions and trillions of dollars in wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green news scam it's one of the greatest scams in history I will repeal crooked Joe and Sayan electric how about the electric vehicle mandate and we will drill baby drill the all cars are going to be electric they don't go far they cost too much and by the way electric cars have a great place they have a great place but but not a place for 100% maybe not a place for 10%
krbTeO0Lo00_52.0,whatever it is they have a place you can't go far and uh they're going to all be made in China they are expensive right now you have hundreds of thousands this is a great time to buy an electric car you know why this you know what you ever noticed the auto companies aren't upset about it they're making cars that can't sell they just can't sell they have hundreds of thousands of you know why because we're spending trillions of dollars in giving them subsidy so the a they auto companies don't care normally they'd all be bankrupt if that were the case they're making cars that can't sell now they want to make your army tanks all electric so that we can go into a community near you no we go into enemy territory we blast the hell out of them but we do it in an environmentally friendly way no do you have no it's crazy we make the greatest army tanks in the world we make him in Ohio we make him in lima
krbTeO0Lo00_53.0,lima I was the one I stopped at they said sir there's a plant that makes y the only plant we have that does it and I was president-elect and I was called by Jim Jordan who's great you know Jim Jordan from Ohio and he said could you take a look at it sir because I don't think he can replace us so anyway I went up Lima I went up and I said uh wow this place is this place is unbelievable makes Ary times that's all they've done for years years and years to make the best tanks of the world they were going to close it under uh I guess it was you know I guess it was Obama but they were it were scheduled to be closed and I looked I said this is a room that 20 times larger than this and it's unbelievable the the you know the ball bearings that heavy oil that heavy steel and you can almost move it with your hand it's so incredible how it all works and these guys are so profession if you close this you'll never be able to open open up a plant with this Talent or this you know this kind of a plant and now they want
krbTeO0Lo00_54.0,and I kept it open I took it off the list and and it's it makes more tanks than anybody in the world right now unfortunately all we do is give the tanks away we make them we give them away faster than we can make them you need some tanks or you we'll send them to you over there and they're expensive suckers too but we'll make we'll we'll provide all of our friends and many of our enemies with tanks because half of the time with and you don't know if their friends or enemies we give them whatever they want but when you look at it but now they want to make them electric and the problem is very similar they don't go far they're too heavy very heavy you know the battery in fact it's be it's so much bigger than a tank for diesel fuel or gasoline that they want to make a truck like a toy truck you know like a little toy truck with a huge battery on the back it's it's almost as big as the army tank so when it goes into enemy territory it's pulling this thing I said what happens if somebody blows it up well let you're dead now you have you don't have to hit the tank you just have to hit the
krbTeO0Lo00_55.0,battery no they want to do it think of it they wanted to now they'll say oh these stories are terrible these stories are you know you heard my story in the boat with the shark right I got killed on that they thought I was rambling I'm not rambling they want to make boats and they are demanding that they be all battery operate all electric and I was in South Carolina at this wonderful family Boatyard that big yard make a lot of boats you know from 17 like fishing boats 17 to 30 feet and I said how's everything going no good they want us to go all electric I said well would that work no because it's so heavy we can't get the boat to float the battery is so heavy so then I start talking about asking questions you know I have I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for many years long I think the longest tenure ever very smart had three different degrees and you know so have an aptitude for things you know there is such a thing as an aptitude I said well
krbTeO0Lo00_56.0,what would happen if this boat is so heavy and started to sink and you're on the top of the boat do you get electrocuted or not in other words the boat is going down and you're on the top will the electric currents flow through the water and wipe you out and let's say there's a shark about 10 yards over there would I have to immediately abandon or could I ride the electric d and said sir uh nobody's ever asked us that question but sir uh I don't know I said well I want to know because I guarantee you one thing I don't care what happens I'm staying with the electric I'm not getting over with it so I tell that story it's you know just fun and the fake news they go he told this crazy story with electric and it's actually not crazy it's sort of a smart story right sort of like you know it's like the snake it's a smart when you you figure what you're leaving in right you're bringing it in the you know the snake right the snake and the snake I
krbTeO0Lo00_57.0,tell that and they do the same thing what does a snake have to do with illegal immigration well I think it has a lot to do with it because that's exactly what you know what you get that's what we're getting we're getting problems like you wouldn't believe right so uh they want to go all electric they want to make our airplanes are fighter jets and electric even though they're 18% less efficient now the difference between 18% and 100% is the difference between being easily and immediately shot down or winning they don't care they don't care and I say why are they doing this they're flying over enemy territory and they don't want to affect the air they're blowing the out of the place but they don't want to think of it they don't want to affect the air they want it to be beautiful air clean air and water boom boom boom these people are stoned called old crazy and these idiots are running our

krbTeO0Lo00_61.0,going to say I'm going to have to go back to the foul language I think but so we have this meeting and he said I started off 50 years ago and every single year that I bought a truck it was better than the first year better than the previous year the truck got better got stronger faster bigger more fuel efficient every year for 50 years those trucks get bigger he said sir I build Apartments we call them apartments or those trucks you would be proud to live in one of those I said I don't know about that you know they build the cabs with a place to stay I said I could handle it I mean I could but he said every year they get better if they force this electric mandate on us we'll go back 70 years not 50 years he said we'll have to stop six times from New York to Los Angeles I said how many times you have to stop now none we go directly New York to Los Angeles all the way no stops I said didn't you explain that to them
krbTeO0Lo00_62.0,yes we do all the time doesn't make any difference to them the other thing I didn't know this he told me that the truck will be more than two times heavier he said so if you do this you're going to have to rebuild every bridge in the country can you believe it no how stupid how stupid is it the other thing is it takes much more room so a lot of your payload is going to be gone it takes much much more room the whole thing will you know possibly never work and it's okay okay some things you got to know but I said so what's their attitude we don't care we want you to go to Electric they don't care they don't care they don't care you can explain it to them they're evil people they're fascists they don't care before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after we win the presidency we win we are going to win not me we I will have if you go and vote Christians please I'll report you to Ralph Reed How about if Ralph didn't vote I wonder I want to check Ralph's voting
krbTeO0Lo00_63.0,record he votes if Ralph if Ralph I would be shocked but you I'm saying that because you have to remember you do have to do it because you don't do it but we will win the presidency and I'll have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine which would have never happened if I were president I will restore that now I'll have that settled but but you know what's happened it's just so it would have never happened you wouldn't have any lives taken you wouldn't have had those ancient cities those gorgeous golden Towers knocked down oblit you could never build that stuff again that history but far more people are dead than they said and you would have never had the attack on Israel on October 7th you would have never had it you would have never had the attack on Israel and you wouldn't have had inflation I had the oil was caused by energy now it's was by everything the energy started it and started it with a with a level of of
krbTeO0Lo00_64.0,nobody's ever seen anything thing like it the the inflation I believe it's the worst inflation this country's ever had and inflation is known as a country Buster so you wouldn't have had just those three things think of if you didn't have Ukraine if you didn't have inflation and if you didn't have the attack on is just those three what a different world is would be just those three and then we could name about 30 more you wouldn't have had that Afghanistan disaster as an example not getting out I was going to get out I was going to keep bam though because it's one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons they given up one of the biggest air bases in the world you know who occupies it now take a guess China China occupies bam thank you very much did they send us a letter president she where's your letter of thanks it's unbelievable I would have kept it not for Afghanistan but it's one hour away from where they make their nuclear weapons and my next term we will build a great Iron Dome over our country a dome like has never been seen before a state-of-the-art

krbTeO0Lo00_67.0,than any man perhaps and I don't like lawyers and I don't like the fees but can you imagine a policeman having to hire a lawyer to defend himself we are going to give immunity to police when they do their job we will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington DC it is so badly run and we will clean it renovate it and re build our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime we are going to have look they go down from places I mean think of it what's happening here they come from Iowa they come from Idaho that those are the two that Biden always gets confused it's wonderful to be in Iowa but he notices the fields are all potato Fields I didn't know they made so many potatoes in Iowa the worst is what he said it's great to be in Florida and he's in Maine you know
krbTeO0Lo00_68.0,you look you look it outside it's freezing it's great to be in Florida I love the people of Florida so much so that we're leading in Florida by about 17 points but we're not going to have this capital of ours that we love and cherish be a victim in itself of all of the murder and crime that's taking place I lost a man who was great person everyone loved him it was a car jack and he was waiting for his wife and somebody came out didn't even give him a warning just said uh just took a gun shot him through the head five months ago shot him through the head the wife is walking out he was picking up the wife from work shot him through the head dumped him out of the into the street took the car they called C him and you know he'll be protected by all sorts of things those people get

krbTeO0Lo00_70.0,some rooms some rooms don't and that's okay but this room does that's good glad I said it actually and I will shut down the Federal Department of Education and we will move everything back to the states where it belongs and where they can individualize education and do it with the love for their children thank you think of it we spend more money per pupil than any country in the world vote oh vote go ahead vote vote vote thank you we spend more money per pupil
krbTeO0Lo00_71.0,think of it you know the expression and I said it to a large African-American group of people four years ago what the hell do you have to lose you're the worst in income you're the worst in crime your cities and your areas are being decimated you can't you can't get a home you can't get mortgage you can't they last on I said and the Democrats have for hundred years run these cities 100 years I said to them what the hell do you have to lose and you know what they agreed with me and I did very well and now we're at the highest level than any Republican has been with African-Americans and with Hispanic Americans now I'm going over this list every single thing was bad I said what do you have to
krbTeO0Lo00_72.0,lose but I say the same thing about the education so we're last per pupil we're last we're at the bottom of the list in terms of the capabilities 40 different countries we're at the bottom of almost every list but we're the top of the list in cost spent per pupil we spend more money per pupil than any other country in the world by far and yet we're last on the list in terms of so what the hell do we have to lose but I also know like places like go back to two I just mentioned but look at Iowa look at Idaho look at some of the you'll have some of the best school systems in the world and you know what we'll do we'll give them about half the money that we send them now and for half the money they'll have a lot of money left over we'll cut we'll cut our budget in half and and not everybody's going going to be great I mean Gavin nusum will not do a good job with education so I you know I don't expect
krbTeO0Lo00_73.0,that out out of him but I and I don't expect it out of certain other PE I don't want to mention too many people but I don't I mean he won't he'll do a horrible job probably be it won't be any worse than it is now can't get any worse but many of the states I would say 40 of the I went over them 40 of the 50 states will do much better and I'll bet you 30 of the states will be phenomenal it'll be like beautiful it'll be like Norway you know Norway has a great education system in New York they said yes we're studying the Norwegian plan oh really you're studying the Norwegian plan well you better bring a lot of cops along because you have a lot of problems right we're studying the plan of Norway and Denmark and actually China is very high on the list I mean China is number three or four on the list think of it can you imagine that China is number three or four on the list no no we're going to give it back to the States and most of those states are going to do a phenomenal job and we'll spend less than half the money on education we'll have
krbTeO0Lo00_74.0,about two people in Washington the two people will make sure that we have to guarantee that they're teaching a little English right that English is out there but basically there won't be a lot of coordination because other than again Common Sense we're going to take we're going to save a fortune and many of our states will produce unbelievable students that will be able to rival Norway and Denmark and all of these places that are some won't and that's okay it's a lot better than it will be now I will also take historic action to defeat the poison of leftwing gender ideology and restore the Timeless truth that God created two genders male and female and I will immediately on my first day sign an executive order to keep men
krbTeO0Lo00_75.0,out of women sports that will take that'll take about 10 minutes and I will fully uphold the Second Amendment because your guns are under siege and I protected them for four years you were protected we will protect innocent life and we will restore Free Speech right from the beginning and I will secure our elections I will secure our elections and as I said our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots proof of citizenship and a thing called voter ID you know when you when you negotiate with the Democrats you start off you start off you say look the one thing we have to have voter ID no deal now I say wait a minute wait let's get this we want voter idea in other words a little identification right nope we don't want to have that why don't they want because they want to cheat that's why they will you know when you go into the Democrat I
krbTeO0Lo00_76.0,always say Democrat you know they'd rather have it the Democratic National it's much nicer sound why don't they change the name it's probably better they hate it when you say the Democrat National Convention right it's much more beautiful actually even when I make a speech if I want to make a nice elegant speech let's say I came in here with a different attitude today and I wanted to make I wanted to really I said the Democratic National Convent now I say the Dem Democrat National Convention it doesn't sound it sounds flat right but I call them that because they don't want to be called that they don't want to be called that but when you go into their convention you've got cards that are like do you ever see some prisoners where they go like this well how about my C did you see that picture of me did you see that do you believe that one my parents said what the hell happened to my boy that was not in the cards they didn't teach me that at the Wharton School of Finance no they're bad these are bad people but they have all sorts of
krbTeO0Lo00_77.0,information they have everything they have everything down so it's okay for them when they have their convention to have a big card on your chest hanging down off your chest but it's no good for voting they don't want it for voting because they want to cheat we're not going to let them get away with it anymore and there is one thing I will say too big to rig you make it too big to rig we don't have to worry about it there's a level at which they can't if you took the 10 worst Presidents in the history of the United States and added them up they would not have done near the destruction to our country as crooked Joe Biden and the Biden Administration have done he's crooked he's a total Thief so if you want to save America get your friends get your family and get everyone out to vote you got to go vote I'll say it again and again vote Christians you gotta vote and do it early if you
