the President's Cabinet."

the President of the United States"

2255.243,
2350.243,
2418.23,"The President:
Good evening. Good evening."
2425.85,"If I were smart,
I'd go home now."
2428.85,
2433.03,
2437.76,"Mr. Speaker.
Madam Vice President."
2441.1,"Members of Congress.
My Fellow Americans."
2445.09,"In January 1941,
President Franklin Roosevelt"
2450.4,"came to this chamber
to speak to the nation."
2453.13,"He said, ""I address 
you at a moment"
2456.37,"unprecedented in the 
history of the Union."""
2459.43,"Hitler was on the march.
War was raging in Europe."
2463.76,"President Roosevelt’s purpose
was to wake up the Congress"
2466.09,"and alert the American people
that this was no ordinary time."
2471.31,"Freedom and democracy were
under assault in the world."
2475.23,"Tonight I come to the same
chamber to address the nation."
2480.27,"Now it is we who face
an unprecedented moment"
2483.91,in the history of the Union.
2485.38,"And yes, my purpose tonight
is to wake up this Congress,"
2488.89,and alert the American people
2490.24,"that this is no
ordinary moment either."
2493.79,"Not since President Lincoln
and the Civil War have freedom"
2497.19,"and democracy been under assault
here at home as they are today."
2501.33,"What makes our moment 
rare is that freedom"
2503.81,"and democracy are under attack,
both at home and overseas,"
2508.64,at the very same time.
2510.89,"Overseas, Putin of 
Russia is on the march,"
2514.63,invading Ukraine
2516.19,"and sowing chaos
throughout Europe and beyond."
2519.84,"If anybody in this room thinks
Putin will stop at Ukraine,"
2523.01,"I assure you, he will not."
2526.55,
2541.34,"Ukraine can stop Putin
if we stand with Ukraine"
2546.12,"and provide the weapons
it needs to defend itself."
2551.9,
2560.73,That is all Ukraine is asking.
2563.13,"They are not asking
for American soldiers."
2565.71,"In fact, there are no American
soldiers at war in Ukraine."
2568.32,"And I am determined
to keep it that way."
2571.94,"But now assistance for 
Ukraine is being blocked"
2576.76,"by those who want us to walk
away from our world leadership."
2579.64,"It wasn’t that long ago
when a Republican President,"
2584.37,"Ronald Reagan, thundered,"
2586.31,"""Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall."""
2591.41,
2598.96,"Now, my predecessor,
a former Republican President,"
2603.42,"tells Putin,
""Do whatever the hell you want."""
2608.37,That's a quote.
2610.57,"A former American President
actually said that,"
2613.26,"bowing down
to a Russian leader."
2615.32,"It’s outrageous. It’s dangerous.
It’s unacceptable."
2620.38,
2629.71,"America is a 
founding member of NATO"
2634.9,"the military alliance
of democratic nations"
2637.82,"created after World War II to
prevent war and keep the peace."
2642.53,"Today, we’ve made NATO
stronger than ever."
2645.9,"We welcomed Finland
to the Alliance last year,"
2650.86,"and just this morning,"
2653.15,"Sweden officially join
and their Prime Minister"
2655.98,"is here tonight.
Stand up."
2659.09,
2661.47,"Welcome. 
Welcome, welcome, welcome."
2671.02,And they know how to fight.
2674.59,"Mr. Prime Minister,
welcome to NATO,"
2676.26,"the strongest military alliance
the world has ever seen."
2683.18,"I say this to Congress:
we must stand up to Putin."
2687.02,"Send me the Bipartisan
National Security Bill."
2691.12,"History is literally watching.
History's watching."
2693.96,"If the United States
walks away now,"
2697.06,it will put Ukraine at risk.
2699.62,"Europe at risk.
The free world at risk,"
2702.28,"emboldening others
who wish to do us harm."
2706.45,"My message to President Putin,"
2707.76,"who've I've know
for a long time is simple."
2710.22,We will not walk away.
2714.53,
2720.78,We will not bow down.
2728.05,I will not bow down.
2730.57,
2734.67,"In a literal sence,
history is watching."
2738.19,"History is watching
just like history"
2741.43,"watched three years ago
on January 6th."
2744.93,"Insurrectionists stormed this
very Capitol and placed a dagger"
2747.72,"at the throat
of American democracy."
2750.28,"Many of you were here
on that darkest of days."
2753.95,We all saw with our own eyes
2756.59,"these insurrectionists
were not patriots."
2759.19,"They had come to stop
the peaceful transfer of power"
2761.38,"and to overturn
the will of the people."
2764.38,"January 6th lies
about the 2020 election,"
2768.01,"and the plots
to steal the election,"
2770.2,"posed the gravest threat to our
democracy since the Civil War."
2776.3,But they failed. America stood.
2782.03,
2788.23,"America stood strong
and democracy prevailed."
2794.06,"But we must be honest the threat
remains and democracy"
2797.32,must be defended.
2799.54,"My predecessor
and some of you here"
2801.27,"seek to bury the truth
of January 6th."
2804.42,I will not do that.
2806.49,"This is a moment to speak
the truth and bury the lies."
2809.44,And here’s the simplest truth.
2812.05,"You can’t love your country
only when you win."
2816.91,
2831.61,"As I’ve done ever since
being elected to office,"
2835.74,"I ask you all,
without regard to party,"
2838.5,"to join together
and defend our democracy."
2840.98,Remember your oath of office
2842.32,"to defend against all threats
foreign and domestic."
2848.8,Respect free and fair elections!
2850.24,"Restore trust
in our institutions!"
2853.06,"And make clear
–political violence"
2854.59,"has absolutely no place,
no place in America. Zero place."
2859.76,
2863.66,"Again. It's not hyperbole to
suggest history is watching."
2874.27,"We're watching.
Your children and grandchildren"
2876.62,"will read about this day
and what we do."
2879.29,"And history is watching
another assault on freedom."
2882.57,"Joining us tonight
is Latorya Beasley,"
2885.09,"a social worker
from Birmingham, Alabama."
2887.53,"14 months ago, 14 months ago
she and her husband welcomed"
2891.26,"a baby girl
thanks to the miracle of IVF."
2894.71,"She scheduled treatments
to have a second child,"
2897.57,"but the Alabama Supreme
Court shut down"
2899.33,"IVF treatments
across the state,"
2901.65,"unleashed by the Supreme
Court decision overturning"
2903.93,Roe v. Wade.
2905.62,"She was told her dream
would have to wait."
2908.34,"What her family has gone through
should never have happened."
2910.45,"And unless Congress acts,
it could happen again."
2912.92,"So tonight, let’s stand up
for families like hers!"
2915.97,"To my friends across the aisle,"
2917.48,"don’t keep families
waiting any longer."
2920.9,"Guarantee the right to IVF.
Guarantee it nationwide!"
2928.08,
2939.08,"Like most Americans,
I believe Roe v. Wade"
2941.41,got it right.
2942.56,"And I thank
Vice President Harris"
2945.1,"for being an incredible leader,"
2946.52,"defending reproductive 
freedom and so much more."
2950.94,
2956.2,"But my predecessor came to
office determined to see Roe v."
2962.0,Wade overturned.
2963.97,"He’s the reason
it was overturned."
2965.21,"In fact, he brags about it."
2967.69,"Look at the chaos
that has resulted."
2971.18,"Joining us tonight is Kate Cox,
a wife and mother from Dallas."
2975.81,"When she became pregnant again,
the fetus had a fatal condition."
2979.95,"Her doctors told Kate
that her own life"
2983.27,"and her ability to have children
in the future"
2987.02,"were at risk
if she didn’t act."
2990.26,"Because Texas law
banned abortion,"
2993.84,"Kate and her husband
had to leave the state"
2995.44,to get the care she needed.
2996.97,What her family has gone through
2998.37,"should never
have happened as well."
3000.8,"But it is happening
to so many others."
3003.32,"There are state laws
banning the freedom to choose,"
3005.84,"criminalizing doctors,"
3007.13,"and forcing survivors of rape
and incest to leave their states"
3011.22,"as well to get
the care they need."
3013.49,"Many of you in this Chamber
and my predecessor"
3016.3,"are promising to pass a national
ban on reproductive freedom."
3019.8,"My God, what freedoms
will you take away next?"
3023.21,"Looks in its decision
to overturn Roe v."
3026.42,"Wade the Supreme Court majority
wrote the following --"
3029.42,"and will all due respect,
Justices."
3031.72,"""Women are not
without electoral power --"
3035.52,"excuse me --
electoral or political power."""
3038.67,"You're about to realize
just how much you"
3040.9,.
3044.455,
3048.51,Clearly --
3050.14,
3057.16,"Clearly, those bragging
about overturning Roe v."
3064.9,"Wade have no clue about
the power of women in America."
3068.03,"But they found out when
reproductive freedom"
3070.79,"was on the ballot
and won in 2022, 2023,"
3073.53,"and they will find out again,
in 2024."
3077.7,
3089.15,"If you the American people
send me a Congress"
3092.67,"that supports the right
to choose,"
3093.88,"I promise you,
I will restore Roe v."
3096.46,"Wade as the law
of the land again!"
3100.0,
3108.07,"Folks, America cannot go back."
3113.02,"I am here tonight to show
what I believe the way forward."
3116.45,"Because I know
how far we’ve come."
3118.83,"Four years ago next week,
before I came to office,"
3122.81,"the country was hit
by the worst pandemic"
3125.36,"and the worst economic
crisis in a century."
3127.95,"Remember the fear.
Record job losses."
3131.34,"Remember the spike in crime.
And the murder rate."
3133.48,"A raging virus that would take
more than"
3136.11,"1 million American
lives of loved ones,"
3139.43,millions of loved ones behind.
3141.24,"A mental health crisis
of isolation and loneliness."
3145.02,"A president, my predecessor,
failed the most basic duty."
3148.44,"Any President owes the American
people the duty to care."
3153.86,That is unforgivable.
3156.02,"I came to office determined
to get us through"
3157.71,"one of the toughest periods
in our nation’s history."
3161.19,"We have. It doesn’t make
the news"
3163.64,"but in thousands of cities
and towns the American people"
3167.18,"are writing the greatest
comeback story never told."
3171.63,
3177.81,"So let’s tell the story here,
tell it here and now."
3183.32,America’s comeback is building
3184.71,"a future
of American possibilities,"
3187.14,"building an economy
from the middle out"
3188.61,"and the bottom up,
not the top down,"
3190.97,"investing in all of America,
in all Americans"
3194.2,"to make sure everyone
has a fair shot"
3196.19,"and we leave no one,
no one behind!"
3199.87,"The pandemic no longer
controls our lives."
3202.87,"The vaccines
that saved us from COVID"
3205.95,"are now being used
to help beat cancer."
3208.36,Turning setback into comeback.
3210.65,"That’s what America does!
That's what America does."
3214.91,
3220.33,"Folks, I inherited an economy
that was on the brink."
3225.66,"Now our economy
is the envy of the world!"
3228.52,"15 million new jobs
in just three years – a record!"
3232.43,A record.
3235.87,Unemployment at 50-year lows.
3241.82,"A record 16 million Americans
are starting small businesses"
3247.32,"and each one
is an act of hope."
3251.39,"With historic job growth
and small business growth"
3253.74,"for Black, Hispanic,
and Asian-Americans."
3256.58,"800,000 new manufacturing jobs
in America and counting."
3262.53,Where is it writing we can't be
3263.98,"the manufacturing
capital of the world?"
3265.83,We are. We will.
3272.13,"More people have health
insurance today"
3273.77,than ever before.
3276.42,"The racial wealth gap is the
smallest it’s been in 20 years."
3280.38,"Wages keep going up
and inflation keeps coming down!"
3283.46,"Inflation has dropped from
9 percent to 3 percent –"
3285.98,the lowest in the world!
3287.23,And trending lower.
3289.15,
3293.59,"That landing is
and will be soft."
3297.79,"And now instead of importing
foreign products"
3300.87,"and exporting American jobs,"
3302.93,"we’re exporting
American products"
3304.38,and creating American jobs –
3307.46,"right here in America
where they belong!"
3310.71,
3316.35,"And it takes time,"
3317.63,"but the American people
are beginning to feel it."
3320.39,"Consumer studies show
consumer confidence is soaring."
3324.14,"Buy America has been the law
of the land since the 1930s."
3329.36,"Past administrations
including my predecessor,"
3332.61,"including some Democrats
as well in the past,"
3335.14,failed to Buy American.
3337.04,Not any more.
3338.83,"On my watch, federal projects
that you fund like helping"
3342.65,"to build American roads,
bridges,"
3344.14,"and highways will be made
with American products"
3347.54,built by American workers.
3349.8,
3354.18,"Creating
good-paying American jobs!"
3362.24,"Thanks to our Chips and
Science Act the United States"
3365.54,"is investing more in research
and development"
3367.3,than ever before.
3369.28,"During the pandemic a
shortage of semiconductor chips"
3372.94,"drove up prices for everything
from cell phones to automobiles."
3376.54,"And by the way,
we invented those chips"
3378.19,right here in America.
3380.3,"Well instead of having
to import them private companies"
3384.57,"are now investing
billions of dollars"
3386.8,"to build new chip factories
here in America!"
3389.29,"Creating
tens of thousands of jobs"
3391.96,"many of those jobs
paying over $100,000 a year"
3394.68,"and don’t require
a college degree."
3398.25,
3404.99,"In fact my policies
have attracted $650 Billion"
3410.82,"in private sector investments
in clean energy"
3413.46,"and advanced
manufacturing"
3414.99,"creating tens of thousands
of jobs here in America!"
3419.87,
3427.81,"And thanks to our
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,"
3430.69,"46,000 new projects
have been announced"
3432.95,"across your communities
– and by the way,"
3435.61,"I noticed some of you
strongly voted against it,"
3437.69,"but they're cheering
on that money coming in."
3440.98,I like it. I'm with you.
3444.17,
3449.64,"If any of you don't want
that money in your district"
3451.72,just let me know.
3454.8,"Modernizing
our roads and bridges,"
3456.36,"ports and airports,
and public transit systems."
3459.22,"Removing poisonous lead pipes
so every child"
3462.44,"can drink clean water
without risk of brain damage."
3465.58,
3470.8,"Providing affordable high
speed internet"
3474.44,"for every American
no matter where you live."
3476.61,"Urban, suburban,
and rural communities --"
3478.86,"in red states
and blue states."
3481.64,"Record investments
in tribal communities."
3484.26,"Because of my investments,"
3485.48,"family farms led by
my Secretary of Agriculture,"
3493.52,"knows more about this
than anybody I know,"
3495.62,"we are better be able to stay
in the family and children"
3500.18,"and grandchildren
won’t have to leave,"
3502.26,leave home to make a living.
3504.05,It’s transformative.
3506.54,"A great comeback story
is Belvidere, Illinois."
3509.76,"Home to an auto plant
for nearly 60 years."
3512.92,"Before I came to office
the plant"
3514.61,"was on its way
to shutting down."
3517.14,"Thousands of workers feared
for their livelihoods."
3520.65,Hope was fading.
3522.81,"Then I was elected to office
and we raised Belvidere"
3524.94,repeatedly with the auto company
3526.48,"knowing unions make
all the difference."
3528.97,"The UAW worked like hell
to keep the plant open"
3532.29,"and get those jobs back.
And together, we succeeded!"
3535.28,"Instead of an auto factory
shutting down an auto factory"
3538.23,"is re-opening and a new
state-of-the art battery factory"
3540.54,"is being built
to power those cars."
3542.34,
3543.55,"Folks, to the folks
of Belvidere,"
3556.48,"I say instead of a town
being left behind your community"
3560.23,moving forward again!
3562.03,"Because instead of watching
auto jobs of the future"
3565.13,"go overseas 4,000 union jobs
with higher wages"
3570.07,"are building that future,
in Belvidere,"
3571.86,right here in America!
3582.54,"Here tonight is UAW President,
Shawn Fain, a great friend,"
3586.97,"and a great labor leader.
Shawn, where are you? Stand up."
3591.6,
3597.71,"And Dawn Simms,"
3603.83,"a third generation
UAW worker in Belvidere."
3608.39,"Shawn, I was proud to be
the first"
3610.65,"President to stand
in the a picket line."
3612.09,"And today Dawn has a job
in her hometown"
3615.81,"providing stability
for her family and pride"
3618.37,and dignity as well.
3619.94,"Showing once again,"
3621.48,"Wall Street didn’t build this
America -- they're not bad guys."
3623.87,They didn't build it though.
3625.31,"The middle class
built this country!"
3626.87,"And unions built
the middle class!"
3630.56,
3641.61,"I say to the American people,"
3644.06,"when Americans gets knocked
down, we get back up!"
3649.08,We keep going!
3651.12,That’s America!
3652.94,

America is coming back!"

our future is brighter!"
3663.91,"It’s because of you that 
tonight we can proudly say"
3668.22,"the State of our Union is strong
and getting stronger!"
3672.97,
3683.385,
3693.35,"Tonight I want to talk about
the future of possibilities"
3697.52,that we can build together.
3699.57,"A future where the days
of trickle-down economics"
3702.14,"are over and the wealthy
and biggest corporations"
3704.79,"no longer get
all the tax breaks."
3707.1,"And by the way,
I understand corporations."
3708.5,"I come from a state
that has more corporation"
3711.12,"than everyone of yours states
in the United States combined."
3715.49,"And I represented them
for 36 years."
3717.26,"I'm not anticorporation.
But I grew up in a home"
3721.54,"where not a lot trickled down
on my Dad’s kitchen table."
3725.61,"That’s why I’m determined
to turn things around"
3727.35,so the middle class does well.
3729.26,"When they do well
the poor have a way up"
3730.69,"and the wealthy
still does well."
3732.8,We all do well.
3734.71,"And there’s more to do
to make sure"
3736.21,"you’re feeling
the benefits of all we’re doing."
3739.47,"Americans pay more
for prescription drugs"
3741.59,than anywhere in the world.
3743.56,It’s wrong and I’m ending it.
3747.68,
3758.1,"With a law I proposed and signed
and not one Republican buddies"
3764.68,"voted for it
we finally beat Big Pharma!"
3768.77,"Instead of paying $400 a month
or thereabouts for insulin"
3772.8,"with diabetes it
only cost $10 bucks to make,"
3775.73,"they only get paid 35 a month
and still make a healthy profit."
3779.69,
3785.28,What to do next?
3787.06,"I want to cap
the cost of insulin"
3788.73,"at $35 a month
for every American who needs it!"
3791.75,Everyone.
3793.13,
3797.95,"For years people have talked
about it"
3801.37,"but I finally got it done
and gave Medicare the power"
3804.14,"to negotiate lower prices
for prescription drugs"
3807.41,"just like the VA
is able to do for our veterans."
3811.45,"That’s not just
saving seniors money."
3813.75,"It’s saving taxpayers money
cutting the federal deficit"
3816.83,by $160 billion
3823.97,because Medicare will no longer
3827.49,"have to pay exorbitant prices
to Big Pharma."
3831.12,"This year Medicare is
negotiating lower prices"
3833.41,"for some of the costliest drugs
on the market"
3835.99,"that treat everything from
heart disease to arthritis."
3838.83,"Now it’s time to go further
and give Medicare the power"
3841.07,"to negotiate lower prices
for 500 different drugs"
3843.83,over the next decade.
3845.47,
3848.96,"They're making a lot of money,
guys."
3853.32,"And they'll still be
extremely profitable."
3856.44,That will not only save lives
3858.77,"it will save taxpayers
another $200 Billion!"
3864.63,"Starting next year that same
law caps total prescription"
3867.49,"drug costs for seniors
on Medicare at $2,000 a year"
3873.09,"even for expensive cancer drugs
that can cost $10,000,"
3875.31,"$12,000, $15,000."
3877.68,"Now I want to cap prescription
drug costs"
3879.54,"at $2,000 a year
for everyone!"
3882.24,
3886.15,"Folks, I'm going to get
in trouble for saying it,"
3892.37,"but anyone want
to get into AirForce One"
3894.04,"we can fly to Toronto,
Berlin, Moscow --"
3897.72,"I mean, excuse me --
well, even Moscow probably."
3902.73,"And bring your prescription
with you and I promise you"
3904.67,"I'll get if for you
for 40 percent"
3906.39,the cost you're paying now.
3907.66,"Same company,
same drug, same place."
3911.25,"Folks, the Affordable Care Act,"
3915.26,"Obamacare is still
a very big deal."
3920.47,
3933.67,Over one hundred million of you
3937.05,"can no longer be denied
health insurance"
3939.38,"because of pre-existing
conditions."
3941.89,"But my predecessor and many
in this chamber"
3945.74,"want to take
that protection away"
3947.71,"by repealing
the Affordable Care Act."
3952.71,"I'm not going to
let that happen!"
3956.85,"We stopped you 50 times before
and we will stop you again!"
3962.7,"In fact I am protecting it
and expanding it."
3965.52,"I enacted tax credits that save
$800 per person per year"
3970.88,reducing health care
3972.19,"premiums for millions
of working families."
3974.66,"Those tax credits
expire next year."
3977.27,"I want to make those savings
permanent!"
3981.07,
3988.53,"To state the obvious, women are
more than half of our population"
3992.59,"but research on women’s health
has always been underfunded."
3996.42,"That’s why we’re launching
the first-ever White House"
3998.38,"Initiative on Women’s
Health Research,"
4000.82,"led by Jill who is doing
an incredible job as First Lady."
4006.2,
4017.52,Pass my plan for $12 Billion
4019.76,"to transform women’s
health research"
4021.94,"and benefit millions
of lives across America!"
4026.12,"I know the cost of housing
is so important to you."
4029.39,"If inflation keeps coming down
mortgage rates"
4031.28,"will come down as well
and the Fed acknowledges that."
4034.87,But I’m not waiting.
4036.68,"I want to provide
an annual tax credit"
4038.75,"that will give Americans $400
a month for the next two years"
4042.74,"as mortgage rates come down
to put toward their mortgage"
4046.0,when they buy a first home
4048.17,"or trade up for
a little more space."
4052.18,That's for two years.
4054.82,
4062.95,"My Administration is also
eliminating title insurance"
4067.65,federally backed mortgages.
4070.4,"When you refinance your home,"
4072.9,"you can save you $1,000
or more as a consequence."
4077.54,"For millions of renters,"
4079.6,"we’re cracking down
on big landlords"
4083.92,"who break antitrust laws
by price-fixing"
4086.85,and driving up rents.
4089.73,"We’ve cut red tape
so more builders"
4092.01,"can get federal financing,
which is already helping build"
4095.21,"a record 1.7 million
new housing units nationwide."
4104.57,"Now pass and build and renovate
2 million affordable homes"
4109.8,and bring those rents down!
4113.44,
4124.75,"To remain the strongest economy
in the world"
4127.77,"we need to have the best
education system in the world."
4130.75,
4133.92,"And I, like I suspect
all of you,"
4137.35,"want to give a child,
every child,"
4139.21,"a good start by providing access
to pre-school for 3-"
4142.62,and 4-year-olds.
4145.1,"You know, I think
I pointed out last year --"
4154.49,"I think I pointed out last year
that children"
4157.39,"coming from broken homes
where there's no books,"
4159.7,"they're not read to,
not spoken to very often,"
4162.63,"start school kindergarten
or first grade hearing"
4165.65,"having heard
a million fewer words spoken,"
4169.1,"Well, studies show,"
4170.69,"that children
who go to pre-school"
4172.04,"are nearly 50 percent more
likely to finish high school"
4174.37,and go on to earn a 2-
4175.59,"or 4-year degree
no matter their background is."
4180.44,
4189.73,I met a year and a half ago
4191.23,"with the leaders
of the business roundtable,"
4193.97,"they were mad,
angry as they were discussing"
4199.41,"why I wanted to spend money
on education."
4202.44,"I pointed out to them,
as Vice President,"
4204.85,I met with over --
4206.43,"I think it was 182 --
don't know the exact number."
4212.34,"And I asked them
what they need most, the COs."
4216.09,"And you've had
the same experience,"
4217.52,both sides of the aisle.
4218.76,"They say a better educated
work force, right?"
4221.55,"So I looked at them.
I said I come from Deleware."
4225.39,"Dupont used to be
the eighth largest corporation"
4227.69,in the world.
4229.91,"And every new enterprise
they bought"
4232.6,"they educated the workforce
to that enterprise."
4235.68,"But none of you
do that anymore."
4238.01,"Why are you angry with me
providing you the opportunity"
4241.22,"for the best educated workforce
in the world."
4243.75,"And they all looked
at me and said,"
4245.93,"""I think you're right."""
4248.13,"I want to expand high-quality
tutoring"
4250.83,"and summer
learning to see to it"
4252.1,"that every child learns
to read by third grade."
4256.14,
4264.38,"I’m also connecting local
businesses and high schools"
4268.46,"so students
get hands-on experience"
4270.64,"and a path
to a good-paying job"
4272.35,"whether or not
they go to college."
4274.85,"And I want to make college
more affordable."
4279.61,"Let’s continue increasing
Pell Grants to working-"
4281.77,and middle-class families
4282.99,"and increase our record
investments in HBCUs"
4286.15,"and and Minority-serving
Institutions,"
4288.67,including Hispanic institutions.
4290.99,
4296.85,"When I was told I couldn't
universally just change the way"
4299.61,"in which we deal
with student loans,"
4302.33,"I fixed two student
loan programs"
4303.92,"that already existed to reduce
the burden of student debt"
4307.74,"for nearly 4 million Americans
including nurses, firefighters,"
4312.46,"and others in public service
like Keenan Jones"
4318.54,"a public-school educator
in Minnesota"
4320.47,who’s here with us tonight.
4321.72,"Keenan, where are you?
Keenan, thank you."
4325.48,"He’s educated hundreds
of students"
4327.07,"so they can go
to college now"
4329.58,"he can help his own daughter
get his own daughter to college."
4340.37,"And folks look, such relief
is good for the economy"
4346.05,"because folks are now able
to buy a home start a business,"
4349.57,start a family.
4352.25,"While we’re at it I want to give
public school teachers a raise!"
4357.46,
4372.75,"And by the way, the first couple
years, we cut the deficit."
4376.37,"Now let me speak to a question
of fundamental fairness"
4378.75,for all Americans.
4380.93,"I’ve been delivering
real results"
4382.36,in a fiscally responsible way.
4384.54,"I’ve already cut
the federal deficit"
4386.01,by over one trillion dollars.
4390.29,"I signed a bipartisan
budget deal"
4392.5,"that will cut another trillion
dollars over the next decade."
4397.28,"It’s my goal to cut the
federal deficit $3 trillion"
4399.84,more by making big corporations
4401.07,"and the very wealthy
finally pay their fair share."
4404.63,
4410.74,"Look, I’m a capitalist."
4414.5,"If you want to make a million
bucks that's great!"
4418.31,"Just pay your fair 
share in taxes."
4424.37,"A fair tax code is how we invest
in the things"
4427.93,"that make a country great,"
4429.63,"health care, education,
defense, and so much more."
4432.39,But here’s the deal.
4434.05,"The last administration enacted
a $2 Trillion tax"
4436.82,"cut that overwhelmingly benefit
the top one percent,"
4440.47,"the very wealthy
and the biggest corporations"
4443.33,"and exploded
the federal deficit."
4449.18,"They added more to
the national debt"
4450.96,"than in any presidential term
in American history."
4454.61,Check the numbers.
4455.86,"For folks at home does anybody
really think"
4458.65,the tax code is fair?
4460.36,Audience: No!
4461.61,"The President:
Do you really think the wealthy"
4462.92,and big corporations
4464.13,"need another $2 trillion
in tax breaks?"
4467.16,Audience: No!
4468.45,"The President:
I sure don’t."
4470.46,"I’m going to keep fighting
like hell to make it fair!"
4472.56,"Under my plan nobody
earning less than $400,000"
4476.92,"will pay an additional penny
in federal taxes."
4479.22,"Nobody. Not one penny.
And they haven't yet."
4486.13,In fact the Child Tax Credit
4490.35,"I passed during the pandemic
cut taxes"
4492.24,"for millions of working families
and cut child poverty in half."
4498.14,Restore the Child Tax Credit
4501.77,"because no child should
go hungry in this country!"
4506.62,"The way to make the tax code
fair is to make big corporations"
4510.89,"and the very wealthy
finally pay their share."
4514.41,"In 2020, 55 of the biggest
companies in America"
4519.21,made $40 Billion in profits
4521.34,"and paid zero
in federal income taxes."
4523.35,Zero.
4524.62,Not any more!
4526.5,"Thanks to the law I wrote
and signed big companies"
4528.7,"now have to pay
a minimum of 15 percent."
4531.09,"But that’s still less
than working people"
4533.76,pay in federal taxes.
4535.84,"It’s time to raise the corporate
minimum tax"
4537.45,to at least 21 percent.
4540.0,
4544.65,"So every big corporation finally
begins to pay their fair share."
4550.42,"I also want to end the tax
breaks for Big Pharma,"
4553.5,"Big Oil, private jets,
and massive executive pay!"
4555.83,"It's only supposed
to be a million dollars"
4558.21,that can be deducted.
4559.72,"They can pay them 20 million
if they want,"
4561.42,but deduct a million.
4563.2,End it now!
4565.16,"There are 1,000 billionaires
in America."
4569.01,"You know what the average
federal tax rate"
4570.57,"for these billionaires is?
No."
4575.12,"They've making great sacrifices.
8.2 percent!"
4579.35,"That’s far less than the vast
majority of Americans pay."
4583.04,"No billionaire should pay
a lower tax rate"
4585.97,"than a teacher,
a sanitation worker, a nurse!"
4588.72,
4600.41,"That’s why I’ve proposed
a minimum tax"
4601.62,"for billionaires of 25%
for billionaires."
4603.78,Just 25 percent.
4605.68,"You know what that would
raise $500 billion"
4610.23,over the next 10 years.
4612.47,"Imagine what that 
could do for America."
4614.88,"Imagine a future
with affordable child care,"
4618.09,"millions of families
can get the care they need"
4619.95,"and still go to work
and help grow the economy."
4622.45,"Imagine a future
with paid leave"
4624.64,"because no one should have
to choose between working"
4627.32,"and taking care of yourself
or a sick family member."
4631.42,"Imagine a future with home
care and elder care"
4635.38,"and people living
with disabilities"
4638.11,"can stay in their homes
and family caregivers"
4641.47,"get they pay
they deserve!"
4643.92,"Tonight, let’s all agree once
again to stand up for seniors!"
4649.82,"Many of my friends
on the other side of the aisle"
4652.82,"want to put Social Security
on the chopping block."
4656.17,"If anyone here tries to cut
Social Security or Medicare"
4658.6,"or raise the retirement age
I will stop you!"
4663.41,
4672.07,"The working people who built
this country"
4674.81,pay more into Social Security
4676.39,"than millionaires
and billionaires do."
4678.68,It’s not fair.
4680.56,We have two ways to go.
4682.72,"Republicans will cut
Social Security"
4684.51,"and give more tax cuts
to the wealthy."
4687.62,That's the proposal.
4689.15,Audience: Boo!
4690.45,"The President:
Oh no."
4691.68,"You guys don't want
another $2 trillion tax cut?"
4695.52,"I kind of thought
that's what your plan was."
4699.47,"Well, that's good to hear."
4701.59,"You're not going to cut
another $2 trillion"
4703.36,"for the super wealthy?
That's good to hear."
4706.41,"I will protect and strengthen
Social Security"
4708.25,"and make the wealthy
pay their fair share!"
4711.72,
4721.12,"Too many corporations
raise their prices"
4724.65,to pad their profits
4726.55,"charging you more and more
for less and less."
4729.58,"That’s why we’re cracking down
on corporations"
4731.55,"that engage in price gouging
or deceptive pricing from food"
4734.98,to health care to housing.
4736.78,"In fact, snack companies
think you won’t notice"
4740.45,"if they charge you just as much
for the same size bag"
4743.27,"and put a hell
of a lot fewer --"
4745.68,"same size bag,
put fewer chips in it."
4749.54,"No, I'm not joking.
It's called shrinkflation."
4752.31,"Pass Bob Casey’s bill
and stop this!"
4756.62,I really mean it.
4768.72,"You probably all saw
that commercial on Snikers bars."
4774.56,"You get to charge the same
amount and you got about,"
4777.05,"I don't know 10 percent
fewer Snikers in it."
4782.2,"I’m also getting rid of junk
fees those hidden fees"
4786.41,"added at the end of your bills
without your knowledge."
4789.79,"My administration just announced
we’re cutting credit card"
4792.27,"late fees
from $32 to just $8."
4793.73,
4794.93,"The banks and credit card
companies are allowed to charge"
4805.31,"what it costs them
to instigate the collection."
4810.11,"And that's more hell of a lot
like $8 than $30 some dollars."
4814.27,"They don’t like it. The credit
card companies don't like it."
4817.59,"But I'm saving American
families $20 billion a year"
4821.4,"with all of the junk fees
I’m eliminating."
4826.65,"Folks at home, that's why
the banks are so mad,"
4830.99,is 20 billion dollars in profit.
4833.99,And I’m not stopping there.
4837.43,"My Administration has proposed
rules to make cable,"
4840.04,"travel, utilities,
and online ticket sellers"
4842.84,"tell you the total price upfront
so there are no surprises."
4848.66,It matters. It matters.
4852.97,And so does this.
4855.74,"In November, my team began
serious negotiations"
4859.23,"with a bipartisan group
of Senators."
4861.92,"The result was a bipartisan bill
with the toughest set"
4864.97,"of border security
reforms we’ve ever seen."
4869.04,Oh you don't think so?
4872.15,"Oh, you don't like
that bill, huh?"
4875.08,"The conservatives got together
and said it was good bill?"
4878.92,"I'll be darned.
That's amazing."
4881.99,That bipartisan deal would hire
4883.44,"1,500 more border
security agents and officers."
4886.8,"100 more immigration judges
to help tackle"
4889.2,"a backload
of 2 million cases."
4891.21,"4,300 more asylum officers
and new policies"
4894.46,"so they can resolve cases in 6
months instead of 6 years now."
4900.21,
4910.01,"100 more high-tech
drug detection machines"
4913.1,"to significantly increase
the ability to screen"
4915.54,"and stop vehicles from smuggling
fentanyl into America"
4918.88,"that's killing
thousands of children."
4922.8,"This bill would save lives
and bring order to the border."
4926.39,"It would also give me
and any new President"
4930.81,new emergency authority
4932.07,"to temporarily shut
down the border"
4934.01,"when the number of migrants
at the border is overwhelming."
4937.16,"The Border Patrol Union
endorsed the bill."
4940.19,"The Federal Chamber of Commerce
had -- yeah, yeah."
4942.71,"You're say no.
Look at the facts."
4945.97,"I know --
I know you now how to read. ."
4957.77,"I believe that given
the opportunity"
4959.59,"a majority
of the House and Senate"
4962.26,"would endorse the bill as well.
The majority right now."
4965.5,"But unfortunately, politics have
derailed this bill so far."
4970.66,"I’m told my predecessor called
members of Congress"
4973.32,"and the Senate
to demand they block the bill."
4976.46,"He feels it would be
a political win for me"
4980.43,and a political loser for him.
4982.43,It’s not about him or me.
4984.22,It’d be a winner --
4987.91,Audience Member: .
5000.84,"The President:
Lincoln Riley,"
5002.59,"and innocent young woman
who was killed by an illegal."
5007.24,"That's right, but how many
thousands of people"
5009.8,are being killed by illegals.
5012.25,"To her parents, I say --
my heart goes out to you,"
5014.74,"having lost children myself.
I understand."
5018.56,"But look, if we change
the dynamic at the border,"
5023.63,"people pay these smugglers 8,000
bucks to get across the border,"
5027.09,"because they know
if they get by,"
5029.58,"if they get by
and let into the country"
5032.4,"it's six to eight years
before they have a hearing."
5035.55,"And it's worth them
taking the change at $8,000."
5039.65,"But if it's only six weeks,"
5044.4,"the idea is that
it's highly unlikely"
5046.32,"that people pay that money
and come all that way knowing"
5049.5,"that they'll be
kicked out quickly."
5052.34,"Folks, I would respectively
suggest my Republican friends"
5059.45,"owe it to the American people
to get this bill done."
5062.35,We need to act now.
5065.28,
5077.86,"And if my predecessor
is watching"
5080.71,"instead of playing politics and
pressuring members of Congress"
5085.02,"to block this bill, join me
in telling Congress to pass it!"
5089.25,"We can do it together.
But that's apparently"
5093.2,what he will not do.
5094.83,"I will not demonize immigrants
saying they"
5097.81,"""poison the blood
of our country"""
5099.35,as he said in his own words.
5101.02,I will not separate families.
5108.0,"I will not ban people
because of their faith."
5112.63,"Unlike my predecessor,
on my first day in office"
5114.76,"I introduced
a comprehensive bill"
5116.54,to fix our immigration system --
5117.85,"take a look at it.
It has all these and more."
5120.39,"Secure the border,
and provide a pathway"
5122.64,"to citizenship for Dreamers
and so much more."
5126.06,"Because unlike my predecessor,
I know who we are as Americans."
5132.21,"We are the only nation
in the world"
5133.85,"with a heart and soul
that draws from old and new."
5137.65,Home to Native Americans
5138.87,"whose ancestors have been here
for thousands of years."
5141.76,"Home to people
from every place on Earth."
5145.44,They came freely.
5146.75,Some came in chains.
5148.49,"Some came when famine struck,"
5149.94,"like my ancestral family
in Ireland."
5152.22,Some to flee persecution.
5154.07,"To chase dreams that
are impossible"
5156.39,"anywhere but here
in America."
5158.73,"That’s America, where we
all come from somewhere,"
5162.31,but we are all Americans.
5165.25,
5173.78,"Looks folks,
we have a simple choice."
5178.11,"We can fight about the border,
or we can fix it."
5184.32,I’m ready to fix it.
5187.05,Send me the border bill now!
5190.81,
5196.87,"A transformational moment
in our history happened"
5201.87,"59 years ago today
in Selma, Alabama."
5206.24,"Hundreds of foot soldiers
for justice marched"
5208.07,"across
the Edmund Pettus Bridge,"
5210.16,"named after a Grand Dragon
of the KKK,"
5213.07,"to claim their fundamental
right to vote."
5215.95,"They were beaten, they were
bloodied and left for dead."
5220.98,"Our late friend
and former colleague"
5222.45,"John Lewis
was on that march."
5224.98,We miss him.
5227.19,
5235.15,"Joining us tonight
are other marchers,"
5242.87,"both in the gallery
and on the floor,"
5245.58,"including Betty May Fikes,
known as the ""Voice of Selma""."
5250.2,"A daughter of gospel singers
and preachers,"
5252.87,"she sang songs of prayer
and protest on that"
5255.66,"Bloody Sunday, to help shake
the nation’s conscience."
5259.45,"Five months later, the Voting
Rights Act was signed into law."
5264.92,
5269.6,"Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you."
5274.56,
5286.88,"But 59 years later, there are
forces taking us back in time."
5293.2,"Voter suppression.
Election subversion."
5296.84,"Unlimited dark money.
Extreme gerrymandering."
5300.79,"John Lewis was a great friend
to many of us here."
5303.53,"But if you truly want
to honor him"
5305.61,"and all the heroes
who marched with him,"
5307.69,"then it’s time
for more than just talk."
5311.39,"Pass the Freedom to Vote Act,"
5314.54,"the John Lewis
Voting Rights Act!"
5318.01,
5326.26,"And stop denying
another core value of America"
5332.28,"our diversity
across American life."
5335.81,Banning books.
5337.26,It’s wrong!
5338.56,"Instead of erasing history,
let’s make history!"
5341.82,"I want to protect other
fundamental rights!"
5344.12,"Pass the Equality Act,"
5347.17,"and my message
to transgender Americans:"
5350.86,I have your back!
5355.44,"Pass the PRO Act
for workers rights!"
5358.49,"And raise the federal
minimum wage"
5365.3,"because every worker
has the right to earn a decent"
5367.32,"living more
than seven bucks and hour."
5372.87,"We are also making history by
confronting the climate crisis,"
5375.41,"not denying it.
I don't think any of you think"
5378.44,"there's no longer
a climate crisis."
5380.63,At least I hope you don't.
5384.03,"I’m taking the most significant
action ever on climate"
5386.41,"ever in the history
of the world."
5389.18,"I am cutting our carbon
emissions in half by 2030."
5392.93,"Creating tens of thousands
of clean-energy jobs,"
5395.41,"like the IBEW workers building
and installing"
5397.65,"500,000 electric vehicle
charging stations."
5401.28,
5403.45,"Conserving 30 percent
of America’s lands"
5407.09,and waters by 2030.
5411.33,"Taking historic action
on environmental justice"
5413.57,for fence-line communities
5414.8,"smothered by
the legacy of pollution."
5419.09,"And patterned after the Peace
Corps and Ameri Corps,"
5422.11,"I’ve launched a Climate Corps
to put 20,000 young people"
5425.94,"to work in the forefront
of our clean energy future."
5429.74,"I’ll triple that number
this decade."
5433.27,
5442.64,"To state the obvious,"
5444.41,"all Americans deserve
the freedom to be safe,"
5448.92,"and America is safer today
than when I took office."
5452.46,"The year before I took office,
murders rats went up 30 percent,"
5456.22,"30 percent they went up,
the biggest increase in history."
5464.55,"It was then through
my American Rescue Plan,"
5469.42,"which every Republican
voted against,"
5470.92,"I’ve made the largest investment
in public safety ever."
5475.57,"Last year, the murder rate"
5476.84,"saw the sharpest decrease
in history,"
5478.53,"and violent crime fell to one
of the lowest levels"
5481.87,in more than 50 years.
5483.84,But we have more to do.
5485.72,"Help cities invest in more
community police officers,"
5488.52,"more mental health workers,"
5489.81,"and more community
violence intervention."
5493.08,"Give communities the tools
to crack down on gun crime,"
5496.3,"retail crime,
and carjacking."
5499.12,"Keep building public trust,"
5500.39,"as I’ve been doing by taking
executive action"
5502.8,"on police reform,"
5504.77,"and calling for it
to be the law of the land,"
5508.54,directing my Cabinet
5509.82,"to review the federal
classification of marijuana,"
5511.89,"and expunging thousands of
convictions for mere possession,"
5515.24,"because no one
should be jailed for using"
5517.89,or have it on their record!
5519.21,"To take on crimes
of domestic violence,"
5527.19,"I am ramping up
federal enforcement"
5529.07,"of the Violence
Against Women Act,"
5530.41,"that I proudly wrote
when I was a Senator,"
5533.21,"so we can finally end
the scourge of violence"
5536.01,against women in America!
5538.31,
5541.79,"And there’s another kind
of violence I want to stop."
5548.9,"With us tonight is Jasmine,
whose 9-year-old sister"
5552.34,"Jackie was murdered
with 21 classmates and teachers"
5555.57,"at her elementary school
in Uvalde, Texas."
5559.05,"Very soon after it happened,"
5560.26,"Jill and I went to Uvalde
for a couple days."
5562.8,"We spent hours and hours
with the families."
5566.13,"We heard their message,
so should everyone in this room,"
5569.02,"in this chamber could hear
the same message."
5572.01,
5574.67,meeting with every family.
5576.75,"They said, ""Do something!
Do something!"""
5581.63,"Well, I did do something"
5582.94,"by establishing the first-ever
Office of Gun Violence"
5585.05,"Prevention in the White House
that Vice President Harris"
5587.9,"is leading the charge.
Thank you for doing it."
5591.58,
5604.1,"Meanwhile, my predecessor
told the NRA"
5608.9,"he’s proud he did nothing
on guns when he was President."
5615.12,"After another school shooting
in Iowa, recently he said,"
5618.5,"when asked what to do about it,
he said ""just get over it."""
5622.4,"That's his quote.
""Just get over it."""
5625.47,"I say we stop it!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
5630.93,
5636.99,"I’m proud we beat the NRA
when I signed"
5639.14,"the most
significant gun safety law"
5641.08,"in nearly 30 years
because of this Congress."
5643.29,Now we must beat the NRA again!
5646.78,"I’m demanding a ban
on assault weapons"
5648.84,and high-capacity magazines!
5652.78,"Pass universal
background checks!"
5657.31,"None of this, none of this --"
5660.96,"I taught the Second Amendment
for 12 years --"
5663.68,"none of this violates
the Second Amendment"
5666.27,"or vilifies responsible
gun owners."
5671.11,"You know, as we manage
challenges at home,"
5672.78,"we’re also managing
crises abroad"
5674.4,including in the Middle East.
5676.95,"I know the last five months
have been gut-wrenching"
5679.4,"for so many people,
for the Israeli people,"
5681.97,"the Palestinian people,
and so many here in America."
5686.25,"This crisis began on October 7th
with a massacre"
5689.49,"by the terrorist group
Hamas as you all know."
5692.81,"1,200 innocent people women and
girls men and boys slaughtered,"
5699.85,many enduring sexual violence.
5702.5,"The deadliest day
for the Jewish people"
5704.98,"since the Holocaust
and 250 hostages taken."
5710.62,"Here in the chamber tonight
are American families"
5713.42,"whose loved ones are still
being held by Hamas."
5716.78,"I pledge to all the families
that we will not rest"
5719.06,"until we bring every one
of your loved ones home."
5722.84,
5737.2,"We will also work
around the clock"
5741.2,"to bring home
Evan and Paul,"
5742.89,"Americans being
unjustly detained"
5745.35,"by the Russians
and others around the world."
5749.35,"Israel has a right
to go after Hamas."
5752.24,"Hamas could end
this conflict today"
5753.72,"by releasing the hostages,
laying down arms,"
5756.48,"could end it by releasing
hostages, laying down arms"
5760.99,"and surrendering those
responsible for October 7th."
5764.81,"Israel has an added burden
because Hamas hides and operates"
5772.05,"among the civilian population
like cowards under hospitals,"
5776.08,"daycare centers
and all the like."
5778.33,"Israel also has
a fundamental responsibility"
5780.43,"though to protect innocent
civilians in Gaza."
5784.43,
5789.91,"This war has taken
a greater toll on innocent"
5797.75,"civilians than all previous wars
in Gaza combined."
5802.09,"More than 30,000 Palestinians
have been killed."
5805.6,Most of whom are not Hamas.
5808.66,"Thousands and thousands are
innocent women and children."
5811.17,"Girls
and boys also orphaned."
5813.83,"Nearly 2 million
more Palestinians"
5816.31,"under bombardment
or displacement."
5818.86,"Homes destroyed,
neighborhoods in rubble,"
5820.5,cities in ruin.
5822.2,"Families without food,
water, medicine."
5824.6,It’s heartbreaking.
5826.78,"I’ve been working non-stop to
establish an immediate ceasefire"
5829.66,"that would last for
at least six weeks"
5831.59,"to get all
the prisoners released,"
5833.13,all the hostages released.
5834.38,"It would get the hostages home,"
5837.28,"ease the intolerable
humanitarian crisis,"
5841.39,"and build toward
something more enduring."
5844.86,"The United States has been
leading international efforts"
5847.73,"to get more humanitarian
assistance into Gaza."
5850.24,"Tonight, I’m directing
the U.S. military"
5852.89,"to lead an emergency mission
to establish a temporary pier"
5856.66,"in the Mediterranean
on the coast of Gaza"
5859.56,"that can receive large ships
carrying food,"
5862.34,"water, medicine
and temporary shelters."
5865.15,"No U.S. boots will be
on the ground."
5868.2,"This temporary pier would
enable a massive increase"
5871.02,"in the amount
of humanitarian assistance"
5872.91,"getting into Gaza
every day."
5875.3,
5881.48,"And Israel must also
do its part."
5886.14,"Israel must allow
more aid into Gaza"
5888.34,"and ensure that
humanitarian workers"
5889.72,"aren’t caught
in the cross fire."
5892.17,"They're announcing
they're going to --"
5896.09,a crossing in northern Gaza.
5898.57,"To the leadership of Israel
I say this."
5901.7,"Humanitarian assistance
cannot be"
5903.64,"a secondary consideration
or a bargaining chip."
5907.04,"Protecting and saving innocent
lives has to be a priority."
5910.72,"As we look to the future,
the only real solution"
5915.39,"is a two-state solution
over time."
5918.22,
5924.33,"And I say this as a lifelong
supporter of Israel,"
5930.63,my entire career --
5932.21,"no one has a stronger record
with this than I do."
5934.47,I challenge any of you hear.
5936.91,"I'm the only American president
to visit Israel in wartime."
5940.82,There is no other path
5942.79,"that guarantees Israel’s
security and democracy."
5945.49,"There is no other path
that guarantees Palestinians"
5948.04,"can live with peace
and dignity."
5951.62,"There is no other path
that guarantees peace"
5953.37,"between Israel
and all of its neighbors,"
5956.28,"including Saudi Arabia,
with whom I’m talking."
5959.17,"Creating stability
in the Middle East"
5960.81,"also means containing
the threat posed by Iran."
5964.73,"That’s why I built a coalition
of more than a dozen countries"
5968.32,"to defend international
shipping and freedom"
5970.73,"of navigation
in the Red Sea."
5972.93,"I’ve ordered strikes to
degrade Houthi capabilities"
5975.44,"and defend U.S. Forces
in the region."
5977.49,"As Commander in Chief,"
5978.74,"I will not hesitate
to direct further measures"
5981.24,"to protect our people
and military personnel."
5984.82,
5992.32,"For years, all I’ve heard"
5994.96,"from my Republican
and Democratic friends"
5997.98,"say that China’s on the rise
and America is falling behind."
6004.43,They’ve got it backwards.
6006.65,"I've been saying it
for over four years,"
6008.34,even when I wasn't President.
6010.3,America is rising.
6012.12,"We have the best economy
in the world."
6014.67,"Since I’ve come to office,
our GDP is up."
6016.54,And our trade deficit with China
6017.94,"is down to the lowest point
in over a decade."
6021.0,"We’re standing up against
China’s unfair"
6023.12,economic practices.
6025.62,"We're standing up for peace
and stability"
6027.5,across the Taiwan Strait.
6030.15,"I’ve revitalized
our partnerships"
6031.65,and alliances in the Pacific.
6034.09,"India, Australia, Japan,
South Korea, Pacific Islands."
6040.79,"I’ve made sure that the most
advanced"
6043.33,"American technologies
can’t be used in China,"
6047.36,"not allowing
to trade them there."
6049.49,"Frankly for all his tough
talk on China,"
6052.36,"it never occurred to
my predecessor to do any that."
6056.72,"We want competition with China,
but not conflict."
6060.45,"And we’re in a stronger position
to win the competition"
6062.73,"for the 21st Century
against China"
6064.32,"or anyone else for that matter.
Than any time as well."
6069.57,"Here at home I’ve signed
over 400 bipartisan bills."
6074.37,"But there’s more to do
to pass my Unity Agenda."
6078.52,"Strengthen penalties
on fentanyl trafficking."
6081.11,"You don’t want to do that, huh?"
6084.29,"Pass bipartisan
privacy legislation"
6086.18,"to protect
our children online."
6091.95,"Harness the promise of A.I.
and protect us from its peril."
6096.64,"Ban A.I. voice impersonations
and more!"
6101.17,"And keep our one truly
sacred obligation,"
6103.82,"to train and equip
those we send into harm’s way"
6107.86,"and care for them and their
families when they come home,"
6110.59,and when they don’t.
6112.85,
6119.96,"That’s why with
the strong support"
6122.71,"and help from Dennis at the VA,
I signed the PACT Act,"
6127.46,"one of the most
significant laws ever,"
6130.68,"helping millions of veterans
who were exposed to toxins"
6133.19,"and who now are battling more
than 100 different cancers."
6139.43,Many of them didn’t come home.
6141.7,"We owe them and
their families support."
6144.85,"And we owe it to ourselves
to keep supporting"
6148.33,"our new health research agency
called ARPA-H and remind us"
6155.04,"that we can do big things
like end cancer as we know it!"
6160.23,And we will.
6162.98,
6172.83,Let me close with this.
6174.76,Audience:
6181.02,The President: Yay!
6182.56,"I know you don't want hear
any more Lindsay,"
6184.27,"but I got to say
a few more things."
6187.9,"I know I may not look like it,
but I’ve been around a while."
6190.79,"And when you get to be 
my age certain things"
6195.25,become clearer than ever before.
6197.8,I know the American story.
6200.12,"Again and again I’ve seen
the contest"
6201.95,"between competing forces
in the battle"
6204.37,for the soul of our nation.
6206.45,"Between those who want
to pull America back to the past"
6209.09,"and those who want to move
America into the future."
6212.57,"My lifetime has taught me to
embrace freedom and democracy."
6216.66,"A future based on
the core values"
6219.06,that have defined America.
6220.76,"Honesty. Decency. 
Dignity. Equality."
6225.19,"To respect everyone.
To give everyone a fair shot."
6228.34,"To give hate
no safe harbor."
6233.02,"Now other people my age
see it differently."
6235.28,"An American story of resentment,
revenge, and retribution."
6241.11,That’s not me.
6243.0,I was born amid World War II
6245.57,"when America stood
for freedom in the world."
6248.67,"I grew up in Scranton,
Pennsylvania and Claymont,"
6250.75,"Delaware among working people
who built this country."
6254.76,"I watched in horror 
as two of my heroes,"
6257.95,"like many of you did,
Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy,"
6260.15,"were assassinated
and their legacies inspired me"
6263.03,"to pursue a career
in service."
6268.14,"I left a law firm,
became a public defender"
6270.04,"because my city of Wilmington
was the only city in America"
6272.44,"occupied by the National Guard
after Dr. King was assassinate"
6276.98,because of the rights.
6279.5,"I became a count county
councilman almost by accident."
6283.04,"I got elected
to the United States"
6284.77,"when I had no intention
of running at age 29,"
6288.89,"then Vice President,
to our first Black President,"
6292.0,"now President to first 
woman Vice President."
6296.02,
6311.49,"In my career I’ve been 
told I’m too young --"
6317.9,"by the way, they didn't let me
on the Senate elevators"
6319.69,for vote sometimes.
6321.45,"Not a joke.
And I've been told I’m too old."
6328.16,"Whether young or old,
I’ve always known what endures."
6333.42,I've known our North Star.
6335.66,"The very idea of America,
that we are all created equal"
6338.43,"and deserve to be treated
equally throughout our lives."
6341.83,"We’ve never fully lived 
up to that idea,"
6344.64,"but we’ve never walked 
away from it either."
6347.42,"And I won’t walk away
from it now."
6351.17,"I’m optimistic. I really am.
I’m optimistic, Nancy."
6363.98,"My fellow Americans the issue
facing our nation"
6370.88,"isn’t how old we are
it’s how old our ideas are?"
6375.89,"Hate, anger, revenge,"
6377.26,"retribution are
the oldest of ideas."
6379.95,"But you can’t lead America
with ancient ideas"
6383.45,that only take us back.
6385.36,"To lead America,
the land of possibilities,"
6388.38,"you need a vision for the future
of what America can"
6390.67,and should be.
6393.89,Tonight you’ve heard mine.
6396.42,"I see a future where defending
democracy,"
6400.3,you don't diminish it.
6401.76,"I see a future where 
we restore the right"
6404.08,"to choose and protect other
freedoms not take them away."
6411.1,"I see a future where the 
middle class finally"
6416.56,"has a fair shot
and the wealthy"
6418.47,"finally have to pay
their fair share in taxes."
6422.83,"I see a future where 
we save the planet"
6425.66,"from the climate crisis and
our country from gun violence."
6431.77,"Above all, I see a future
for all Americans!"
6438.37,"I see a country
for all Americans!"
6441.57,"And I will always be a
