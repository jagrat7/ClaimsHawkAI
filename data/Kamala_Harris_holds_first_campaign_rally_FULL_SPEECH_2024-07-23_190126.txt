leaders including my friend the great governor of Wisconsin Tony iers he's here somewhere my dear friend senator Tammy Baldwin and you know I had the privilege of serving with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate and she is always fighting for the people of this state and I know that the folks that are here are going to make sure you return her to Washington DC in November yes we are going to elect her back to Washington DC it is so good to be here also with lieutenant governor Sarah Rodriguez attorney general Josh Cole Wisconsin Secretary of State Sarah godoi County Executive David David Crowley mayor Cavalier Johnson and the great state party chair Ben wickler who I have worked with Ben you and I have been working together for years and I can attest he knows how to build the infrastructure that delivers winds up and down the ballot thank you Ben so it is good to be back in Wisconsin and it is great to be in Milwaukee as many of you know our state Campaign Headquarters are in this city s and that there is a reason for that the path to the White House goes through Wisconsin yes it does and to win in Wisconsin we are counting on you right here in Milwaukee and you all helped us win in 2020 and in 2024 we will win again yes we are so Milwaukee I want to start by saying a few words and I could really speak at length but a few words about our incredible President Joe Biden it has truly been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve as vice president to our President Joe Biden Joe's Legacy of accomplishment over his entire career and over the past three and a half years is unmatched in modern history in one term think about it in one term as president he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who served two terms in office and I know we are all deeply deeply grateful for his continuing service to our nation and it is my great honored to have Joe Biden's endorsement in this race so Wisconsin I am told as of this morning that we have earned the support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination and I am so very honored and I pledge to you I will spend the coming weeks continuing to unite our party so that we are ready to win in November so friends we have 105 days until election day and in that time we've got some work to do but we're not afraid of hard work we like hard work don't we and we will win this election yes we will so as Leah told you before I was elected vice president before I was elected United States Senator I was elected Attorney General of the State of California and I was a courtroom prosecutor before then and in those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds Predators who Abused women frauders who ripped off consumers cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain so hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type  and in this campaign I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week as Attorney General of California I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students as a prosecutor I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse well Trump was found liable for committing sexual  abuse as Attorney General of California I took on the Big Wall Street Banks and held them accountable for fraud fraud Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34  counts but let's also make no mistake this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump this campaign is about who we fight for this is about who we fight for just look at how we are running our campaigns so Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations and he is trading access in exchange for campaign contributions a couple of months ago yall saw that a couple months ago at maril Lago he literally promised big oil companies big lobbyists he would do their bidding for $1 billion in campaign donations on the other hand we are running a people powered campaign and we just had some breaking news we just had the best 24 hours of grassroot fundraising in presidential campaign history all right and because we are a people powerered campaign that is how you know we will be a people first presidency and Wisconsin this campaign is also about two different Visions for our nation one where we are focused on the future the other focused on the past we believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead a future where no child has to grow up in poverty where every worker has the freedom to join a union where every person has a Affordable Health Care affordable child care and paid family leave we believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity so all of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because here's the thing we all here Wisconsin know when our middle class is strong America is strong but Donald Trump wants to take our country backward he and his extreme project 20 25 agenda will weaken the middle class like we know we got to take this serious thing can you believe they put that thing in writing read it it's 900 pages but here's the thing you when you read it you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare he intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make Working Families foot the  bill they intend to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back then to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions remember what that was like children with asthma women who survived breast cancer Grand Grand parents with Diabetes America has tried these failed economic policies before but we are not going back we are not going back not going back we're not going back we are  back back and I'll tell you why we're not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for Freedom generations of America's be generations and we have to remember this the shoulders on which we stand generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom and now Wisconsin the Baton is in our hands we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote we'll make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted we who believe that every person in our nation should who should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence will finally pass red flag laws Universal background checks and an assault weapons ban and we who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do and when Congress passed passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as president of the United States I will sign it into law so Wisconsin ultimately in this election we each face a question what kind of country do we want to live in a country and to your point do we want to live in a country of Freedom compassion and rule of law or a country of chaos fear and hate and here's the beauty of this moment we each have the power to answer that question the power is with the people we each have the power to answer that question and in the next 105 days then we have work to do we have doors to knock on we have phone calls to make we have voters to register and we have an election to win so Wisconsin today I ask you are you ready to get to work do we believe in Freedom do we believe in Opportunity do we believe in the promise of America and are we ready to fight for it and when we fight we win God bless you God bless the United States of America bur FL fre freed I can't move freom me to change
