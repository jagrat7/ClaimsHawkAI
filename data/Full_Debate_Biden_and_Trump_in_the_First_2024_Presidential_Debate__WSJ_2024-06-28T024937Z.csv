qqG96G8YdcE_169,169.92,6.039,the economy President Biden inflation
qqG96G8YdcE_172,172.76,5.16,has slowed but prices remain high since

qqG96G8YdcE_177,177.92,5.72,has increased for example basket of
qqG96G8YdcE_180,180.4,4.24,groceries that cost $100 then now costs
qqG96G8YdcE_183,183.64,3.8,more than
qqG96G8YdcE_184,184.64,5.44,$120 and typical home prices have jumped
qqG96G8YdcE_187,187.44,4.879,more than 30% what do you say to voters
qqG96G8YdcE_190,190.08,3.76,who feel they are worse off under your
qqG96G8YdcE_192,192.319,3.48,presidency than they were under
qqG96G8YdcE_193,193.84,4.2,President Trump we got to take a look at
qqG96G8YdcE_195,195.799,4.921,what I was left when I became president
qqG96G8YdcE_198,198.04,5.08,what Mr Trump left me we had an economy
qqG96G8YdcE_200,200.72,5.0,that was in freefall the pandemic was so
qqG96G8YdcE_203,203.12,4.6,badly handled many people were dying all
qqG96G8YdcE_205,205.72,3.68,he said was it's not that serious just
qqG96G8YdcE_207,207.72,3.48,inject a little bleach into your arm
qqG96G8YdcE_209,209.4,4.039,you'll be all right the economy
qqG96G8YdcE_211,211.2,5.08,collapsed there were no jobs
qqG96G8YdcE_213,213.439,4.921,unemployment rate Rose to 15% it was
qqG96G8YdcE_216,216.28,4.2,terrible and so what we had to do is try
qqG96G8YdcE_218,218.36,4.439,to put things back together again that's
qqG96G8YdcE_220,220.48,6.0,exactly what we began to do we created
qqG96G8YdcE_222,222.799,6.08,"15,000 new jobs we brought out position"
qqG96G8YdcE_226,226.48,4.64,"where we have 800,000 new manufacturing"
qqG96G8YdcE_228,228.879,3.961,jobs but there's more to be done there's
qqG96G8YdcE_231,231.12,3.839,more to be done workingclass people are
qqG96G8YdcE_232,232.84,4.2,still in trouble I come from Scranton
qqG96G8YdcE_234,234.959,3.84,Pennsylvania I come of household where
qqG96G8YdcE_237,237.04,3.52,the kitchen table if the things weren't
qqG96G8YdcE_238,238.799,3.881,able to be met during the mon was a a
qqG96G8YdcE_240,240.56,3.759,problem price of eggs the price of gas
qqG96G8YdcE_242,242.68,3.199,the price of housing the price of a
qqG96G8YdcE_244,244.319,3.92,whole range of things that's why I'm
qqG96G8YdcE_245,245.879,4.0,working so hard to make sure I deal with
qqG96G8YdcE_248,248.239,4.0,those problems and we're going to make
qqG96G8YdcE_249,249.879,4.161,sure that we reduce the price of housing
qqG96G8YdcE_252,252.239,3.401,we're going to make sure we build two
qqG96G8YdcE_254,254.04,3.56,two million new units we're going to
qqG96G8YdcE_255,255.64,3.999,make sure we cap rents so corporate
qqG96G8YdcE_257,257.6,3.44,greed can't take over the combination
qqG96G8YdcE_259,259.639,2.84,but of was left with in corporate greed
qqG96G8YdcE_261,261.04,3.92,is the reason why we're in this problem
qqG96G8YdcE_262,262.479,4.72,right now in addition to that we're in a
qqG96G8YdcE_264,264.96,3.56,situation where if you had take a look
qqG96G8YdcE_267,267.199,3.641,at all that was done in his
qqG96G8YdcE_268,268.52,4.28,administration he he didn't do much at
qqG96G8YdcE_270,270.84,5.44,all by the time he left there things
qqG96G8YdcE_272,272.8,5.0,were in chaos literally chaos and so we
qqG96G8YdcE_276,276.28,3.44,put things back together we created I
qqG96G8YdcE_277,277.8,4.72,said those jobs we make sure we had a
qqG96G8YdcE_279,279.72,4.4,situation where we now we brought down
qqG96G8YdcE_282,282.52,5.16,the price of prescription drugs which is
qqG96G8YdcE_284,284.12,7.56,a major issue for many people to $15 for
qqG96G8YdcE_287,287.68,6.84,for uh a insulin shot as opposed to $400
qqG96G8YdcE_291,291.68,5.12,no senior has to pay more than $200 for
qqG96G8YdcE_294,294.52,5.28,any drug all the drugs they can include
qqG96G8YdcE_296,296.8,3.88,beginning next year in a situation as
qqG96G8YdcE_299,299.8,3.16,make and we're going to make that
qqG96G8YdcE_300,300.68,3.76,available to everybody to all Americans
qqG96G8YdcE_302,302.96,3.32,so we're working to bring down the price
qqG96G8YdcE_304,304.44,4.039,of around the kitchen table and that's
qqG96G8YdcE_306,306.28,4.4,what we're going to get done thank you
qqG96G8YdcE_308,308.479,5.28,president Trump we had the greatest
qqG96G8YdcE_310,310.68,6.32,economy in the history of our country we
qqG96G8YdcE_313,313.759,5.081,have never done so well every everybody

qqG96G8YdcE_318,318.84,5.88,copying us we got hit with covid and
qqG96G8YdcE_322,322.24,4.079,when we did we spent the money necessary
qqG96G8YdcE_324,324.72,3.72,so we wouldn't end up in a Great
qqG96G8YdcE_326,326.319,4.521,Depression the likes of which we had in
qqG96G8YdcE_328,328.44,3.84,1929 but by the time we finished so we
qqG96G8YdcE_330,330.84,3.04,did a great job we got a lot of credit
qqG96G8YdcE_332,332.28,4.479,for the economy a lot of credit for the
qqG96G8YdcE_333,333.88,5.159,military and no Wars and so many other
qqG96G8YdcE_336,336.759,3.88,things everything was rocking good but
qqG96G8YdcE_339,339.039,3.401,the thing we never got the credit for
qqG96G8YdcE_340,340.639,4.761,and we should have is getting us out of
qqG96G8YdcE_342,342.44,5.199,that covid mess uh he created mandates
qqG96G8YdcE_345,345.4,4.44,that was a disaster for our country but
qqG96G8YdcE_347,347.639,5.4,other than that we had we had given them

qqG96G8YdcE_353,353.039,4.481,actually was higher than preco and
qqG96G8YdcE_355,355.199,4.761,nobody thought that was even possible uh
qqG96G8YdcE_357,357.52,4.2,the only jobs he created are for illegal
qqG96G8YdcE_359,359.96,4.28,immigrants and bounceback jobs a
qqG96G8YdcE_361,361.72,4.0,bounceback from the co he has not done a

qqG96G8YdcE_376,376.56,4.88,greatest economy in the world and you
qqG96G8YdcE_378,378.84,6.0,know the fact of the matter is that uh
qqG96G8YdcE_381,381.44,6.12,we PR ourselves in a situation where his
qqG96G8YdcE_384,384.84,4.28,his economy he rewarded the wealthy he

qqG96G8YdcE_391,391.84,4.04,larger than any president has in any one
qqG96G8YdcE_393,393.68,4.4,term he's the only President other than
qqG96G8YdcE_395,395.88,4.08,Herbert Hoover who's had lost more jobs
qqG96G8YdcE_398,398.08,4.08,than he had when he began since Herbert
qqG96G8YdcE_399,399.96,4.92,Hoover the idea that he did something
qqG96G8YdcE_402,402.16,4.599,that was significant in the military you
qqG96G8YdcE_404,404.88,4.12,know when he was president there were
qqG96G8YdcE_406,406.759,3.921,still killing people in Afghanistan he
qqG96G8YdcE_409,409.0,2.88,didn't do anything about that when he
qqG96G8YdcE_410,410.68,3.88,was President we were still find
qqG96G8YdcE_411,411.88,5.92,ourselves in a position where you had a
qqG96G8YdcE_414,414.56,5.6,notion that we were this safe country
qqG96G8YdcE_417,417.8,5.239,the truth is I'm the only president
qqG96G8YdcE_420,420.16,5.56,this Century that doesn't have any this
qqG96G8YdcE_423,423.039,5.761,this decade that don't any troops dying

qqG96G8YdcE_431,431.0,3.0,can you want I allowed to respond to him
qqG96G8YdcE_433,433.039,1.961,well I'm going to ask you a follow up

qqG96G8YdcE_435,435.0,3.919,minute that we give you um I I want to
qqG96G8YdcE_436,436.759,4.84,follow up you you want to impose a 10%
qqG96G8YdcE_438,438.919,4.28,tariff on all Goods coming into the US
qqG96G8YdcE_441,441.599,3.28,how will you ensure that that doesn't
qqG96G8YdcE_443,443.199,2.84,drive prices even higher not going to
qqG96G8YdcE_444,444.879,2.561,drive them higher it's just going to
qqG96G8YdcE_446,446.039,3.761,cause countries that have been ripping
qqG96G8YdcE_447,447.44,4.319,us off for years like China and many
qqG96G8YdcE_449,449.8,3.839,others in all fairness to China it's
qqG96G8YdcE_451,451.759,4.321,going to just force them to pay us a lot
qqG96G8YdcE_453,453.639,4.081,of money reduce our deficit tremendously
qqG96G8YdcE_456,456.08,3.679,and give us a lot of power for other
qqG96G8YdcE_457,457.72,3.4,things but he would he made a statement
qqG96G8YdcE_459,459.759,3.961,the only thing he was right about is I
qqG96G8YdcE_461,461.12,4.4,gave you the largest tax cut in history
qqG96G8YdcE_463,463.72,3.479,I also gave you the largest regulation
qqG96G8YdcE_465,465.52,3.6,cut in history that's why we had all the
qqG96G8YdcE_467,467.199,3.56,jobs and the jobs went down and then
qqG96G8YdcE_469,469.12,3.84,they bounced back and he's taking credit
qqG96G8YdcE_470,470.759,5.601,for bounceback jobs you can't do that he
qqG96G8YdcE_472,472.96,5.48,also said he inherited 9% inflation now
qqG96G8YdcE_476,476.36,4.44,he inherited almost no inflation and it
qqG96G8YdcE_478,478.44,4.319,stayed that way for 4 15 months and then
qqG96G8YdcE_480,480.8,4.2,it blew up under his leadership because
qqG96G8YdcE_482,482.759,3.641,they spent money like a bunch of people
qqG96G8YdcE_485,485.0,2.479,that didn't know what they were doing
qqG96G8YdcE_486,486.4,2.759,and they don't know what they were doing
qqG96G8YdcE_487,487.479,3.72,it was the worst probably the worst
qqG96G8YdcE_489,489.159,4.201,Administration in history there's never
qqG96G8YdcE_491,491.199,3.801,been and as far as Afghanistan is
qqG96G8YdcE_493,493.36,3.72,concerned I was getting out of
qqG96G8YdcE_495,495.0,5.319,Afghanistan but we were getting out with
qqG96G8YdcE_497,497.08,5.2,dignity with strength with power he got
qqG96G8YdcE_500,500.319,4.28,out it was the most embarrassing day in
qqG96G8YdcE_502,502.28,4.08,the history of our country's life
qqG96G8YdcE_504,504.599,3.921,president Trump over the last eight
qqG96G8YdcE_506,506.36,4.6,years under both of your administrations
qqG96G8YdcE_508,508.52,4.12,the national debt soord to record highs
qqG96G8YdcE_510,510.96,2.959,and according to a new nonpartisan
qqG96G8YdcE_512,512.64,3.759,analysis president Trump your
qqG96G8YdcE_513,513.919,4.521,Administration approved $8.4 trillion in
qqG96G8YdcE_516,516.399,4.841,new debt while so far President Biden
qqG96G8YdcE_518,518.44,4.68,you've approved $4.3 trillion in new
qqG96G8YdcE_521,521.24,3.92,debt so former president Trump many of
qqG96G8YdcE_523,523.12,4.64,the tax cuts that you signed into law
qqG96G8YdcE_525,525.16,4.96,are set to expire next year you want to
qqG96G8YdcE_527,527.76,4.44,extend them and go even further you say
qqG96G8YdcE_530,530.12,4.719,with the US facing trillion dollar
qqG96G8YdcE_532,532.2,4.92,deficits and record debt why should top
qqG96G8YdcE_534,534.839,4.641,earners and corporations pay even less
qqG96G8YdcE_537,537.12,4.52,in taxes than they do now because the
qqG96G8YdcE_539,539.48,3.96,tax cuts spurred the greatest economy
qqG96G8YdcE_541,541.64,3.639,that we've ever seen just prior to co
qqG96G8YdcE_543,543.44,3.639,and even after Co it was so strong that
qqG96G8YdcE_545,545.279,4.081,we were able to get through Co much
qqG96G8YdcE_547,547.079,5.0,better than just about any other country
qqG96G8YdcE_549,549.36,5.08,but we spurred that tax spurred now when
qqG96G8YdcE_552,552.079,5.081,we cut the taxes as an example the uh
qqG96G8YdcE_554,554.44,6.079,corporate tax was cut down to 21% from
qqG96G8YdcE_557,557.16,6.119,39% plus beyond that uh we took in more
qqG96G8YdcE_560,560.519,4.641,Revenue with much less tax and companies
qqG96G8YdcE_563,563.279,4.481,were bringing back trillions of dollars
qqG96G8YdcE_565,565.16,4.76,back into our country the country was
qqG96G8YdcE_567,567.76,3.92,going like never before and we were
qqG96G8YdcE_569,569.92,3.52,ready to start paying down debt we're
qqG96G8YdcE_571,571.68,3.839,ready to start using the liquid gold
qqG96G8YdcE_573,573.44,3.8,right under our feet the oil and gas
qqG96G8YdcE_575,575.519,4.161,right under our feet we were going to
qqG96G8YdcE_577,577.24,4.719,have something that nobody else has had
qqG96G8YdcE_579,579.68,4.399,we got hit with covid we did a lot to
qqG96G8YdcE_581,581.959,4.761,fix it I gave him an unbelievable
qqG96G8YdcE_584,584.079,4.481,situation with all of the Therapeutics
qqG96G8YdcE_586,586.72,4.239,and all of the things that we came up
qqG96G8YdcE_588,588.56,5.519,with we we gave him something great
qqG96G8YdcE_590,590.959,4.961,remember more people died under his
qqG96G8YdcE_594,594.079,4.44,administration even though we had
qqG96G8YdcE_595,595.92,4.039,largely fixed it more people died under
qqG96G8YdcE_598,598.519,3.041,his administration
qqG96G8YdcE_599,599.959,3.161,than our Administration and we were
qqG96G8YdcE_601,601.56,3.16,right in the middle of it something
qqG96G8YdcE_603,603.12,4.0,which a lot of people don't like to talk
qqG96G8YdcE_604,604.72,4.72,about but he had far more people dying
qqG96G8YdcE_607,607.12,4.88,in his administration he did the mandate
qqG96G8YdcE_609,609.44,4.44,which is a disaster mandating it the
qqG96G8YdcE_612,612.0,4.0,vaccine went out he did a mandate on the
qqG96G8YdcE_613,613.88,4.639,vaccine which is the thing that people
qqG96G8YdcE_616,616.0,4.8,most objected to about the vaccine and
qqG96G8YdcE_618,618.519,4.601,he did a very poor job just a very poor
qqG96G8YdcE_620,620.8,4.2,job and I will tell you not only poor
qqG96G8YdcE_623,623.12,4.08,there but throughout the entire world
qqG96G8YdcE_625,625.0,3.92,we're no longer respected as a country
qqG96G8YdcE_627,627.2,3.92,they don't respect our leadership they
qqG96G8YdcE_628,628.92,4.52,don't respect the United States anymore
qqG96G8YdcE_631,631.12,4.76,we're like a third world Le between
qqG96G8YdcE_633,633.44,4.639,weaponization of his election trying to
qqG96G8YdcE_635,635.88,3.959,go after his political opponent all of
qqG96G8YdcE_638,638.079,4.801,the things he's done we've become like a
qqG96G8YdcE_639,639.839,5.481,third world nation and it's a shame the
qqG96G8YdcE_642,642.88,4.6,damage he's done to our country and I'd
qqG96G8YdcE_645,645.32,4.04,love to ask him and will why he allowed
qqG96G8YdcE_647,647.48,4.64,millions of people to come in here from
qqG96G8YdcE_649,649.36,4.88,prisons jails and mental institutions to
qqG96G8YdcE_652,652.12,4.24,come into our country and destroy our
qqG96G8YdcE_654,654.24,4.279,country president Trump we will get to
qqG96G8YdcE_656,656.36,3.719,immigration uh later in this block

qqG96G8YdcE_660,660.079,3.801,opportunity to respond to this question
qqG96G8YdcE_661,661.68,3.959,about the national debt he had the
qqG96G8YdcE_663,663.88,4.84,largest national debt of any president
qqG96G8YdcE_665,665.639,5.561,fouryear period number one number two

qqG96G8YdcE_671,671.2,4.84,very wealthy I what I'm going to do is

qqG96G8YdcE_682,682.519,6.32,they in fact pay 88.2% in taxes if they
qqG96G8YdcE_685,685.56,6.48,just paid 24% or 25% either one of those
qqG96G8YdcE_688,688.839,4.921,numbers they'd raised $500 million
qqG96G8YdcE_692,692.04,3.84,billion dollars I should say in a
qqG96G8YdcE_693,693.76,4.0,10-year period we'd be able to WR wipe
qqG96G8YdcE_695,695.88,3.88,out his debt we'd be able to help make

qqG96G8YdcE_782,782.16,4.799,absolutely criminal thank you president
qqG96G8YdcE_784,784.88,4.56,Trump danana this is the first
qqG96G8YdcE_786,786.959,5.721,presidential election since the Supreme
qqG96G8YdcE_789,789.44,5.639,Court overturned roie Wade this morning
qqG96G8YdcE_792,792.68,5.08,the Court ruled on yet another abortion
qqG96G8YdcE_795,795.079,5.641,case temporarily allowing emergency
qqG96G8YdcE_797,797.76,5.12,abortions to continue in Idaho despite
qqG96G8YdcE_800,800.72,4.679,that State's restrictive ban former
qqG96G8YdcE_802,802.88,5.36,president Trump you take credit for the
qqG96G8YdcE_805,805.399,4.921,decision to overturn roie Wade which
qqG96G8YdcE_808,808.24,4.839,returned the issue of abortion to the
qqG96G8YdcE_810,810.32,4.84,states correct however the federal
qqG96G8YdcE_813,813.079,5.401,government still plays a role in whether
qqG96G8YdcE_815,815.16,6.799,or not women have access to abortion
qqG96G8YdcE_818,818.48,6.68,pills they're used in about 2third of
qqG96G8YdcE_821,821.959,5.88,all abortions as president would you
qqG96G8YdcE_825,825.16,4.72,block abortion medication first of all
qqG96G8YdcE_827,827.839,4.56,the Supreme Court just approved the
qqG96G8YdcE_829,829.88,4.28,abortion pill and I agree with their
qqG96G8YdcE_832,832.399,4.601,decision to have done that and I will
qqG96G8YdcE_834,834.16,5.2,not block it and if you look at this
qqG96G8YdcE_837,837.0,5.0,whole question that you're asking a
qqG96G8YdcE_839,839.36,5.56,complex but not really complex 51 years
qqG96G8YdcE_842,842.0,4.639,ago you had Ro v Wade and everybody
qqG96G8YdcE_844,844.92,3.599,wanted to get it back to the States
qqG96G8YdcE_846,846.639,4.361,everybody without exception Democrats
qqG96G8YdcE_848,848.519,4.201,Republicans liberals conservatives
qqG96G8YdcE_851,851.0,4.56,everybody wanted it back religious
qqG96G8YdcE_852,852.72,4.799,leaders and what I did is I put three
qqG96G8YdcE_855,855.56,4.44,great Supreme Court Justices on the
qqG96G8YdcE_857,857.519,5.401,court and they happened to vote in favor
qqG96G8YdcE_860,860.0,4.92,of killing Ro v Wade and moving it back
qqG96G8YdcE_862,862.92,4.8,to the States this is something that
qqG96G8YdcE_864,864.92,4.52,everybody wanted now 10 years ago or so
qqG96G8YdcE_867,867.72,3.799,they started talking about how many and
qqG96G8YdcE_869,869.44,4.639,how many this getting into other things
qqG96G8YdcE_871,871.519,5.12,but every legal scholar throughout the
qqG96G8YdcE_874,874.079,4.68,world the most respected wanted it
qqG96G8YdcE_876,876.639,4.081,brought back to the States I did that
qqG96G8YdcE_878,878.759,4.08,now the states are working it out if you
qqG96G8YdcE_880,880.72,3.96,look at Ohio it was a decision that was
qqG96G8YdcE_882,882.839,3.281,it was an end result that was a little
qqG96G8YdcE_884,884.68,3.68,bit more liberal than you would have
qqG96G8YdcE_886,886.12,4.76,thought uh Kansas I would say the same
qqG96G8YdcE_888,888.36,4.159,thing uh Texas is different Florida is
qqG96G8YdcE_890,890.88,4.319,different but they're all making their
qqG96G8YdcE_892,892.519,4.76,own decisions right now and right now
qqG96G8YdcE_895,895.199,4.681,the states control it that's the vote of
qqG96G8YdcE_897,897.279,5.081,the people like Ronald re rean I believe
qqG96G8YdcE_899,899.88,4.8,in the exceptions I am a person that
qqG96G8YdcE_902,902.36,3.719,believes and frankly I think it's
qqG96G8YdcE_904,904.68,2.56,important to believe in the exceptions
qqG96G8YdcE_906,906.079,3.161,some people you have to follow your
qqG96G8YdcE_907,907.24,4.68,heart some people don't believe in that
qqG96G8YdcE_909,909.24,5.039,but I believe in the exceptions for rape
qqG96G8YdcE_911,911.92,4.2,incest and the life of the mother I
qqG96G8YdcE_914,914.279,3.881,think it's very important some people
qqG96G8YdcE_916,916.12,4.44,don't follow your heart but you have to
qqG96G8YdcE_918,918.16,3.88,get elected also and because that has to
qqG96G8YdcE_920,920.56,3.76,do with other things you got to get
qqG96G8YdcE_922,922.04,4.599,elected the problem they have is they're
qqG96G8YdcE_924,924.32,4.4,radical because they will take the life
qqG96G8YdcE_926,926.639,4.161,of a child in the eighth month the ninth
qqG96G8YdcE_928,928.72,3.72,month and even after birth after birth
qqG96G8YdcE_930,930.8,4.36,if you look at the former governor of
qqG96G8YdcE_932,932.44,5.04,Virginia he was willing to do this he
qqG96G8YdcE_935,935.16,3.799,said we'll put the baby aside and we'll
qqG96G8YdcE_937,937.48,3.919,determine what we do with the baby
qqG96G8YdcE_938,938.959,4.12,meaning we'll kill the baby what
qqG96G8YdcE_941,941.399,4.041,happened is we brought it back to the
qqG96G8YdcE_943,943.079,4.44,states and the country is now coming
qqG96G8YdcE_945,945.44,4.36,together on this issue it's been a great
qqG96G8YdcE_947,947.519,4.56,thing thank you President Biden it's
qqG96G8YdcE_949,949.8,4.159,been a terrible thing what you've done
qqG96G8YdcE_952,952.079,3.521,the fact is that the vast majority of
qqG96G8YdcE_953,953.959,5.12,constitutional Scholars support it row
qqG96G8YdcE_955,955.6,5.359,when it was decided support it row and
qqG96G8YdcE_959,959.079,3.88,was that's this idea that they're all
qqG96G8YdcE_960,960.959,3.481,against it is just ridiculous and this
qqG96G8YdcE_962,962.959,3.481,is the guy who says the state should be
qqG96G8YdcE_964,964.44,4.44,able to have it we're in a state we're
qqG96G8YdcE_966,966.44,4.0,in six weeks you don't even know whether
qqG96G8YdcE_968,968.88,3.959,you're pregnant or not but you cannot
qqG96G8YdcE_970,970.44,4.759,see a doctor have your and have him
qqG96G8YdcE_972,972.839,4.44,decide on what your circumstances are
qqG96G8YdcE_975,975.199,3.601,whether you need help the idea that
qqG96G8YdcE_977,977.279,3.401,states are able to do this is a little
qqG96G8YdcE_978,978.8,3.839,like saying we're going to turn civil
qqG96G8YdcE_980,980.68,3.92,rights back to the States Let each state
qqG96G8YdcE_982,982.639,3.88,have a different rule look there's so
qqG96G8YdcE_984,984.6,4.84,many young women who have been including
qqG96G8YdcE_986,986.519,5.88,a young woman who just was murdered and
qqG96G8YdcE_989,989.44,5.839,he he went to the funeral uh the idea
qqG96G8YdcE_992,992.399,5.321,that she was murdered by a by by an
qqG96G8YdcE_995,995.279,4.441,immigrant coming into they talk about
qqG96G8YdcE_997,997.72,4.359,that but here's the deal there's a lot
qqG96G8YdcE_999,999.72,4.88,of young women are being raped by their
qqG96G8YdcE_1002,1002.079,6.32,by their in-laws by their by by their
qqG96G8YdcE_1004,1004.6,5.44,spouses brothers and sisters by just
qqG96G8YdcE_1008,1008.399,3.281,it's it's just ridiculous and they can
qqG96G8YdcE_1010,1010.04,3.159,do nothing about it and they try to
qqG96G8YdcE_1011,1011.68,4.279,arrest them when they cross state line
qqG96G8YdcE_1013,1013.199,5.44,thank you there have been many young
qqG96G8YdcE_1015,1015.959,5.12,women murdered by the same people he
qqG96G8YdcE_1018,1018.639,4.2,allowed to come across our border we

qqG96G8YdcE_1235,1235.799,4.921,to get a bipartisan agreement that not
qqG96G8YdcE_1237,1237.76,5.919,only changed all of that made sure that
qqG96G8YdcE_1240,1240.72,4.36,we are in a situation where you had no
qqG96G8YdcE_1243,1243.679,3.36,circumstance where they could come

qqG96G8YdcE_1255,1255.12,4.16,my position in addition to that we find
qqG96G8YdcE_1257,1257.44,3.92,ourselves in a situation where when he
qqG96G8YdcE_1259,1259.28,4.16,was president he was taking separating
qqG96G8YdcE_1261,1261.36,4.559,babies from their mothers putting them
qqG96G8YdcE_1263,1263.44,4.599,in cages making sure they were the
qqG96G8YdcE_1265,1265.919,4.161,families were separated that's not the
qqG96G8YdcE_1268,1268.039,4.401,right way to go what I've done since
qqG96G8YdcE_1270,1270.08,4.479,I've changed the law what's happened
qqG96G8YdcE_1272,1272.44,5.2,I've changed it in a way that now you're

qqG96G8YdcE_1279,1279.6,3.559,that's better than when he left office

qqG96G8YdcE_1526,1526.96,4.16,think he did it just because I approved

qqG96G8YdcE_1531,1531.12,4.4,many people at our border by allowing

qqG96G8YdcE_1700,1700.96,5.0,war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian
qqG96G8YdcE_1703,1703.519,6.561,territory it is already claimed and
qqG96G8YdcE_1705,1705.96,6.4,Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO
qqG96G8YdcE_1710,1710.08,4.92,are Putin's terms acceptable to you
qqG96G8YdcE_1712,1712.36,5.64,first of all our veterans and our
qqG96G8YdcE_1715,1715.0,4.88,soldiers can't stand this guy they can't
qqG96G8YdcE_1718,1718.0,3.32,stand him they think he's the worst

qqG96G8YdcE_1723,1723.76,4.32,stand him so let's get that straight and
qqG96G8YdcE_1726,1726.24,4.4,they like me more than just about any of
qqG96G8YdcE_1728,1728.08,5.439,them and that's based on every single
qqG96G8YdcE_1730,1730.64,5.44,bit of information as far as Russia and
qqG96G8YdcE_1733,1733.519,4.681,Ukraine if we had a real president the
qqG96G8YdcE_1736,1736.08,4.28,president that knew that was respected
qqG96G8YdcE_1738,1738.2,4.8,by Putin he would have never he would
qqG96G8YdcE_1740,1740.36,4.64,have never invaded Ukraine a lot of
qqG96G8YdcE_1743,1743.0,3.36,people are dead right now much more than
qqG96G8YdcE_1745,1745.0,2.88,people know you know they talk about
qqG96G8YdcE_1746,1746.36,3.88,numbers you can double those numbers
qqG96G8YdcE_1747,1747.88,3.919,maybe triple those numbers he did
qqG96G8YdcE_1750,1750.24,3.88,nothing to stop it in fact I think he
qqG96G8YdcE_1751,1751.799,3.841,encouraged Russia from going in I tell
qqG96G8YdcE_1754,1754.12,4.12,you what happened he was so bad with
qqG96G8YdcE_1755,1755.64,4.56,Afghanistan it was such a horrible
qqG96G8YdcE_1758,1758.24,3.96,embarrassment most embarrassing moment
qqG96G8YdcE_1760,1760.2,3.719,in the history of our country that when
qqG96G8YdcE_1762,1762.2,3.319,Putin watched that and he saw the
qqG96G8YdcE_1763,1763.919,3.48,incompetence that he should he should
qqG96G8YdcE_1765,1765.519,3.721,have fired those generals like I fired
qqG96G8YdcE_1767,1767.399,3.64,the one that you mentioned and so he's
qqG96G8YdcE_1769,1769.24,4.319,got no love loss but he should have
qqG96G8YdcE_1771,1771.039,5.36,fired those generals no General got
qqG96G8YdcE_1773,1773.559,4.161,fired for the most embarrassing moment
qqG96G8YdcE_1776,1776.399,3.64,in the history of our country
qqG96G8YdcE_1777,1777.72,4.839,Afghanistan where we left billions of
qqG96G8YdcE_1780,1780.039,5.24,dollars of equipment behind we lost 13
qqG96G8YdcE_1782,1782.559,4.441,beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were
qqG96G8YdcE_1785,1785.279,3.361,obliterated and by the way we left
qqG96G8YdcE_1787,1787.0,4.12,people behind too we left American
qqG96G8YdcE_1788,1788.64,4.48,citizens behind when Putin saw that he
qqG96G8YdcE_1791,1791.12,4.84,said you know what I think we're going
qqG96G8YdcE_1793,1793.12,5.159,to go in and maybe take my this was his
qqG96G8YdcE_1795,1795.96,4.48,dream I talked to him about it his dream
qqG96G8YdcE_1798,1798.279,6.0,the difference is he never would have
qqG96G8YdcE_1800,1800.44,6.8,invaded Ukraine never just like Israel
qqG96G8YdcE_1804,1804.279,6.12,would have never been invaded in a
qqG96G8YdcE_1807,1807.24,5.24,million years by Hamas you know why
qqG96G8YdcE_1810,1810.399,3.76,because Iran was broke with me I
qqG96G8YdcE_1812,1812.48,3.12,wouldn't let anybody do business with
qqG96G8YdcE_1814,1814.159,3.441,them they ran out of money they were
qqG96G8YdcE_1815,1815.6,4.04,broke they had no money for Hamas they
qqG96G8YdcE_1817,1817.6,4.079,had no money for anything no money for
qqG96G8YdcE_1819,1819.64,5.159,Terror that's why you had no Terror at
qqG96G8YdcE_1821,1821.679,6.561,all during my Administration this place
qqG96G8YdcE_1824,1824.799,5.801,the whole world is blowing up under him
qqG96G8YdcE_1828,1828.24,4.159,President Biden I've never heard so much
qqG96G8YdcE_1830,1830.6,3.439,malar in my whole life look the fact of
qqG96G8YdcE_1832,1832.399,3.88,the matter is that we're in a situation
qqG96G8YdcE_1834,1834.039,5.841,where let's take the last Point first
qqG96G8YdcE_1836,1836.279,5.921,Iran attacked American troops kill
qqG96G8YdcE_1839,1839.88,4.6,caused brain damage for a number of
qqG96G8YdcE_1842,1842.2,4.479,these troops and he did nothing about it
qqG96G8YdcE_1844,1844.48,4.039,recent when he was president they they
qqG96G8YdcE_1846,1846.679,4.161,attacked he said they're just having
qqG96G8YdcE_1848,1848.519,4.241,headaches that's all it is he didn't do
qqG96G8YdcE_1850,1850.84,4.88,a thing when they attack took place
qqG96G8YdcE_1852,1852.76,6.96,number one number two we got over
qqG96G8YdcE_1855,1855.72,6.72,"100,000 Americans and others out of of"
qqG96G8YdcE_1859,1859.72,5.0,Afghanistan during that airlift number
qqG96G8YdcE_1862,1862.44,4.479,three we found ourselves in a situation
qqG96G8YdcE_1864,1864.72,5.72,where if you take a look at what Trump
qqG96G8YdcE_1866,1866.919,6.321,did in Ukraine he this guy told Ukraine
qqG96G8YdcE_1870,1870.44,5.119,told Trump do whatever you want and do
qqG96G8YdcE_1873,1873.24,5.559,whatever you want and that's exactly
qqG96G8YdcE_1875,1875.559,5.161,what Trump did to Putin encourage him do
qqG96G8YdcE_1878,1878.799,3.6,whatever you want and he went in listen
qqG96G8YdcE_1880,1880.72,3.88,to what he said when he went in it was
qqG96G8YdcE_1882,1882.399,3.601,going to take ke in five days remember
qqG96G8YdcE_1884,1884.6,2.799,because it's part of the old Soviet
qqG96G8YdcE_1886,1886.0,2.72,Union that's what he wanted to
qqG96G8YdcE_1887,1887.399,3.921,reestablish
qqG96G8YdcE_1888,1888.72,4.52,ke and he in fact didn't do it at all he
qqG96G8YdcE_1891,1891.32,4.199,didn't wasn't able to get it done and
qqG96G8YdcE_1893,1893.24,5.72,they've lost over they've lost thousands
qqG96G8YdcE_1895,1895.519,5.241,"of thousands of troops 500,000 troops"
qqG96G8YdcE_1898,1898.96,3.52,president Trump I come back to you for
qqG96G8YdcE_1900,1900.76,3.84,for one minute I just want to go back to
qqG96G8YdcE_1902,1902.48,4.919,my original question which is are
qqG96G8YdcE_1904,1904.6,4.559,Putin's terms acceptable to you keeping
qqG96G8YdcE_1907,1907.399,4.64,the territory in UK acceptable no
qqG96G8YdcE_1909,1909.159,4.681,they're not acceptable but look this is
qqG96G8YdcE_1912,1912.039,4.0,a war that never should have started if
qqG96G8YdcE_1913,1913.84,5.48,we had a leader in this war he led
qqG96G8YdcE_1916,1916.039,6.401,everybody along he's given $200 billion
qqG96G8YdcE_1919,1919.32,5.28,now or more to Ukraine he's given $200
qqG96G8YdcE_1922,1922.44,3.76,billion that's a lot of money I don't
qqG96G8YdcE_1924,1924.6,4.0,think there's ever been anything like it
qqG96G8YdcE_1926,1926.2,4.079,every time that zalinski comes to this
qqG96G8YdcE_1928,1928.6,3.84,country he walks away with $60 billion
qqG96G8YdcE_1930,1930.279,3.88,do he's the greatest salesman ever and
qqG96G8YdcE_1932,1932.44,4.719,I'm not knocking him I'm not knocking
qqG96G8YdcE_1934,1934.159,5.841,anything I'm only saying the money that
qqG96G8YdcE_1937,1937.159,4.48,we're spending on this war and we
qqG96G8YdcE_1940,1940.0,4.519,shouldn't be spending it should have
qqG96G8YdcE_1941,1941.639,5.801,never happened I will have that War
qqG96G8YdcE_1944,1944.519,5.16,settled between Putin and zalinski as
qqG96G8YdcE_1947,1947.44,4.68,president elect before I take office on
qqG96G8YdcE_1949,1949.679,5.761,January 20th I'll have that War settled
qqG96G8YdcE_1952,1952.12,5.799,people being killed so needlessly so
qqG96G8YdcE_1955,1955.44,4.8,stupidly and I will get it settled and
qqG96G8YdcE_1957,1957.919,5.6,I'll get it settled fast before I take

qqG96G8YdcE_1963,1963.519,5.16,the fact is that Putin is a war criminal
qqG96G8YdcE_1966,1966.2,5.599,he's killed thousands and thousands of
qqG96G8YdcE_1968,1968.679,5.561,people and he has made one thing clear
qqG96G8YdcE_1971,1971.799,4.681,he wants to reestablish what was part of
qqG96G8YdcE_1974,1974.24,4.2,the Soviet Empire not just a pieace he
qqG96G8YdcE_1976,1976.48,3.679,wants all of Ukraine that's what he
qqG96G8YdcE_1978,1978.44,4.479,wants and then you think he'll stop
qqG96G8YdcE_1980,1980.159,4.681,there do you think he'll stop when he if
qqG96G8YdcE_1982,1982.919,3.6,he if he takes Ukraine what do you think

qqG96G8YdcE_1989,1989.96,4.599,a war you ought to find out what he's
qqG96G8YdcE_1992,1992.24,5.279,going to do because if in fact he does
qqG96G8YdcE_1994,1994.559,5.161,what he says and walks away by the way
qqG96G8YdcE_1997,1997.519,3.561,all that money we give Ukraine from
qqG96G8YdcE_1999,1999.72,3.28,weapons we make here in the United
qqG96G8YdcE_2001,2001.08,4.24,States we give them the weapons not the
qqG96G8YdcE_2003,2003.0,5.559,money at this point and and our NATO
qqG96G8YdcE_2005,2005.32,5.719,allies have produced as much funding for
qqG96G8YdcE_2008,2008.559,4.921,Ukraine as we have that's why it's
qqG96G8YdcE_2011,2011.039,5.681,that's why we're strong thank you moving
qqG96G8YdcE_2013,2013.48,5.559,on to the Middle East in October Hamas
qqG96G8YdcE_2016,2016.72,4.36,attacked Israel killing more than a
qqG96G8YdcE_2019,2019.039,4.721,thousand people and taking hundreds of
qqG96G8YdcE_2021,2021.08,5.479,hostages among those held and thought to
qqG96G8YdcE_2023,2023.76,4.639,still be alive our five Americans
qqG96G8YdcE_2026,2026.559,3.521,Israel's response has killed thousands
qqG96G8YdcE_2028,2028.399,4.601,of Palestinians and created a
qqG96G8YdcE_2030,2030.08,6.36,humanitarian crisis in Gaza President
qqG96G8YdcE_2033,2033.0,5.32,Biden you've put forward a a proposal to
qqG96G8YdcE_2036,2036.44,5.0,resolve this conflict
qqG96G8YdcE_2038,2038.32,5.0,but so far Hamas has not released the
qqG96G8YdcE_2041,2041.44,3.839,remaining hostages and Israel is
qqG96G8YdcE_2043,2043.32,5.0,continuing its military offensive in
qqG96G8YdcE_2045,2045.279,6.36,Gaza so what additional leverage will
qqG96G8YdcE_2048,2048.32,6.44,you use to get Hamas and Israel to end
qqG96G8YdcE_2051,2051.639,6.361,the war you have two minutes number one

qqG96G8YdcE_2062,2062.72,4.24,endorsed the plan I put forward endorsed
qqG96G8YdcE_2065,2065.04,5.039,the plan I put forward which has three
qqG96G8YdcE_2066,2066.96,6.8,stages to it the first stage is trade
qqG96G8YdcE_2070,2070.079,5.6,the hostages for a ceasefire second
qqG96G8YdcE_2073,2073.76,4.8,phase is a ceasefire with additional
qqG96G8YdcE_2075,2075.679,4.761,conditions the third phase is no the end
qqG96G8YdcE_2078,2078.56,4.24,of the war the only one who wants the
qqG96G8YdcE_2080,2080.44,4.04,war to continue is Hamas number one
qqG96G8YdcE_2082,2082.8,4.48,they're the only ones standing out we're
qqG96G8YdcE_2084,2084.48,5.399,still pushing hard from to get them to
qqG96G8YdcE_2087,2087.28,4.799,accept in the meantime what's happened
qqG96G8YdcE_2089,2089.879,5.641,in Israel we're find the only thing I've
qqG96G8YdcE_2092,2092.079,5.321,"denied Israel was 2,000lb bombs they"
qqG96G8YdcE_2095,2095.52,3.8,don't work very well in populated areas
qqG96G8YdcE_2097,2097.4,3.4,they whole lot innocent people we're
qqG96G8YdcE_2099,2099.32,3.36,providing Israel with all the weapons
qqG96G8YdcE_2100,2100.8,4.44,they need and when they need them and by
qqG96G8YdcE_2102,2102.68,4.679,the way I'm the guy that organized the
qqG96G8YdcE_2105,2105.24,4.48,world against Iran when they had a
qqG96G8YdcE_2107,2107.359,4.961,full-blown intercontinental bistic
qqG96G8YdcE_2109,2109.72,5.44,ballistic missile attack on Israel no
qqG96G8YdcE_2112,2112.32,6.24,one was hurt no one Israeli was
qqG96G8YdcE_2115,2115.16,6.679,accidentally killed and it stopped we
qqG96G8YdcE_2118,2118.56,5.08,saved Israel we are the biggest producer
qqG96G8YdcE_2121,2121.839,3.881,of support for Israel of anyone in the
qqG96G8YdcE_2123,2123.64,4.76,world and so that's they're two
qqG96G8YdcE_2125,2125.72,4.52,different things Hamas can not be
qqG96G8YdcE_2128,2128.4,3.719,allowed to be continue we continue to
qqG96G8YdcE_2130,2130.24,4.119,send our experts and our intelligent
qqG96G8YdcE_2132,2132.119,4.881,people as to how they can get Hamas like
qqG96G8YdcE_2134,2134.359,4.48,we did Ben Laden you don't have to do it
qqG96G8YdcE_2137,2137.0,3.92,and by the way they've been greatly
qqG96G8YdcE_2138,2138.839,4.52,weakened toas greatly weakened and they
qqG96G8YdcE_2140,2140.92,4.52,should be they should be eliminated but
qqG96G8YdcE_2143,2143.359,6.201,you've got to be careful for what using
qqG96G8YdcE_2145,2145.44,4.12,certain weapons among population
qqG96G8YdcE_2149,2149.68,5.24,centers just going back to Ukraine for
qqG96G8YdcE_2151,2151.92,6.48,one second we have an ocean separating
qqG96G8YdcE_2154,2154.92,5.919,us the European nations together
qqG96G8YdcE_2158,2158.4,5.48,have spent a hundred billion or maybe
qqG96G8YdcE_2160,2160.839,4.441,more than that less than us why doesn't
qqG96G8YdcE_2163,2163.88,3.199,he call them and say you got to put up
qqG96G8YdcE_2165,2165.28,3.68,your money like I did with NATO I got
qqG96G8YdcE_2167,2167.079,4.04,them to put up hundreds of billions of
qqG96G8YdcE_2168,2168.96,3.84,dollars the Secretary General of NATO
qqG96G8YdcE_2171,2171.119,3.2,said Trump did the most incredible job
qqG96G8YdcE_2172,2172.8,2.84,I've ever seen you wouldn't they
qqG96G8YdcE_2174,2174.319,3.601,wouldn't have any they were going out of
qqG96G8YdcE_2175,2175.64,5.56,business we were spending almost 100% of
qqG96G8YdcE_2177,2177.92,5.96,the money was was paid by us he didn't
qqG96G8YdcE_2181,2181.2,4.399,do that he's getting all you got to ask
qqG96G8YdcE_2183,2183.88,3.88,these people to put up the money we're
qqG96G8YdcE_2185,2185.599,4.401,over a hundred billion dollar more spent
qqG96G8YdcE_2187,2187.76,4.079,and it has a bigger impact on them
qqG96G8YdcE_2190,2190.0,4.04,because of location because we have an
qqG96G8YdcE_2191,2191.839,6.641,ocean in between you got to ask them as
qqG96G8YdcE_2194,2194.04,5.72,far as Israel and and Hamas Israel is
qqG96G8YdcE_2198,2198.48,2.68,the one that wants to go he said the
qqG96G8YdcE_2199,2199.76,3.8,only one who wants to keep going is
qqG96G8YdcE_2201,2201.16,4.12,Hamas actually Israel is the one and you
qqG96G8YdcE_2203,2203.56,3.48,should let him go and let him finish a
qqG96G8YdcE_2205,2205.28,3.96,job he doesn't want to do it he's become
qqG96G8YdcE_2207,2207.04,4.079,like a Palestinian but they don't like
qqG96G8YdcE_2209,2209.24,2.96,him because he's a very bad Palestinian
qqG96G8YdcE_2211,2211.119,3.601,he's a weak
qqG96G8YdcE_2212,2212.2,4.36,one President Biden you have a minute
qqG96G8YdcE_2214,2214.72,3.399,I've never heard so much foolishness
qqG96G8YdcE_2216,2216.56,3.519,this is a guy who wants to get out of
qqG96G8YdcE_2218,2218.119,4.321,NATO are you going to stay in NATO he's
qqG96G8YdcE_2220,2220.079,4.481,going to pull out of NATO the idea that
qqG96G8YdcE_2222,2222.44,4.76,we have our strength lies in our
qqG96G8YdcE_2224,2224.56,4.84,alliances as well it may be a big ocean
qqG96G8YdcE_2227,2227.2,4.28,but we ever able to avoid a war in in
qqG96G8YdcE_2229,2229.4,4.24,Europe a major war in Europe what
qqG96G8YdcE_2231,2231.48,4.52,happens if in fact you have Putin
qqG96G8YdcE_2233,2233.64,4.479,continue to go into into NATO we have an
qqG96G8YdcE_2236,2236.0,3.96,article five agreement attack on one is
qqG96G8YdcE_2238,2238.119,3.561,Attack on all you want to start the
qqG96G8YdcE_2239,2239.96,4.359,nuclear war he keeps talking about go
qqG96G8YdcE_2241,2241.68,5.2,ahead let Putin go in and control
qqG96G8YdcE_2244,2244.319,4.0,Ukraine and then move on to Poland and
qqG96G8YdcE_2246,2246.88,3.479,other places
qqG96G8YdcE_2248,2248.319,3.721,see what happens then he has no idea
qqG96G8YdcE_2250,2250.359,3.681,what the hell he's talking about and by
qqG96G8YdcE_2252,2252.04,4.52,the way I got 50 other nations around
qqG96G8YdcE_2254,2254.04,5.16,the world to support Ukraine including
qqG96G8YdcE_2256,2256.56,4.559,Japan and South Korea because they
qqG96G8YdcE_2259,2259.2,4.36,understand that this this this kind of
qqG96G8YdcE_2261,2261.119,5.2,dislocation has a serious threat to the
qqG96G8YdcE_2263,2263.56,3.92,whole world peace no no major war in
qqG96G8YdcE_2266,2266.319,4.081,Europe has ever been able to be
qqG96G8YdcE_2267,2267.48,5.32,contained just to Europe president Trump
qqG96G8YdcE_2270,2270.4,4.439,just to follow up would you support the
qqG96G8YdcE_2272,2272.8,3.76,creation of an independent Palestinian
qqG96G8YdcE_2274,2274.839,3.641,state in order to achieve peace in the
qqG96G8YdcE_2276,2276.56,4.68,region I'd have to to see but before we
qqG96G8YdcE_2278,2278.48,5.0,do that the problem we have is that we
qqG96G8YdcE_2281,2281.24,4.44,spend all the money so they kill us on
qqG96G8YdcE_2283,2283.48,4.8,trade I made great trade deals with the
qqG96G8YdcE_2285,2285.68,4.24,European nations because if you add them
qqG96G8YdcE_2288,2288.28,3.76,up they're about the same size
qqG96G8YdcE_2289,2289.92,4.36,economically their economy is about the
qqG96G8YdcE_2292,2292.04,4.84,same size as the United States and they
qqG96G8YdcE_2294,2294.28,4.16,were no cars no they don't want anything
qqG96G8YdcE_2296,2296.88,3.479,that we have but we're supposed to take
qqG96G8YdcE_2298,2298.44,5.159,their cars their food their everything
qqG96G8YdcE_2300,2300.359,4.521,their agriculture I changed that but the
qqG96G8YdcE_2303,2303.599,4.24,big thing I changed is they don't want
qqG96G8YdcE_2304,2304.88,5.84,to pay and the only reason that he can
qqG96G8YdcE_2307,2307.839,4.641,play games with NATO is because I got
qqG96G8YdcE_2310,2310.72,4.28,them to put up hundreds of billions of
qqG96G8YdcE_2312,2312.48,4.879,dollars I said and he's right about this
qqG96G8YdcE_2315,2315.0,4.359,I said no I'm not going to support NATO
qqG96G8YdcE_2317,2317.359,3.641,if you don't pay they asked me that
qqG96G8YdcE_2319,2319.359,4.361,question would you guard us against
qqG96G8YdcE_2321,2321.0,5.92,Russia at a very secret meeting of the
qqG96G8YdcE_2323,2323.72,5.0,28 uh States at that time Nations at
qqG96G8YdcE_2326,2326.92,3.76,that time and they said no if you don't
qqG96G8YdcE_2328,2328.72,4.28,pay I won't do that and you know what
qqG96G8YdcE_2330,2330.68,4.28,happened billions and billions of
qqG96G8YdcE_2333,2333.0,4.64,dollars came flowing in the next day and
qqG96G8YdcE_2334,2334.96,4.119,the next months but now we're we're in
qqG96G8YdcE_2337,2337.64,3.479,the same position we're paying
qqG96G8YdcE_2339,2339.079,4.161,everybody's bills let's turn to the
qqG96G8YdcE_2341,2341.119,4.681,issue of democracy former president
qqG96G8YdcE_2343,2343.24,5.119,Trump I want to ask you about January 6
qqG96G8YdcE_2345,2345.8,4.44,2021 after you rallied your supporters
qqG96G8YdcE_2348,2348.359,3.881,that day some of them stormed the
qqG96G8YdcE_2350,2350.24,4.8,capital to stop the constitutionally
qqG96G8YdcE_2352,2352.24,4.68,mandated counting of electoral votes as
qqG96G8YdcE_2355,2355.04,4.4,president you swore an oath to quote
qqG96G8YdcE_2356,2356.92,4.52,preserve protect and defend unquote the
qqG96G8YdcE_2359,2359.44,4.04,Constitution what do you say to voters
qqG96G8YdcE_2361,2361.44,3.84,who believe that you violated that oath
qqG96G8YdcE_2363,2363.48,3.52,through your actions and in action on
qqG96G8YdcE_2365,2365.28,3.36,January 6 and worry that you'll do it
qqG96G8YdcE_2367,2367.0,3.2,again I don't think too many believe
qqG96G8YdcE_2368,2368.64,5.76,that and let me tell you about January
qqG96G8YdcE_2370,2370.2,6.56,6th on January 6th we had a great border
qqG96G8YdcE_2374,2374.4,4.32,nobody coming through very few on
qqG96G8YdcE_2376,2376.76,4.04,January 6th we were energy independent
qqG96G8YdcE_2378,2378.72,4.8,on January 6th we had the lowest taxes
qqG96G8YdcE_2380,2380.8,5.12,ever we had the lowest regulations ever
qqG96G8YdcE_2383,2383.52,4.559,on January 6 we were respected all over
qqG96G8YdcE_2385,2385.92,4.8,the world all over the world we were
qqG96G8YdcE_2388,2388.079,4.641,respected and then he comes in and we're
qqG96G8YdcE_2390,2390.72,4.639,now left that we're like a bunch of
qqG96G8YdcE_2392,2392.72,5.08,stupid people that what happened to the
qqG96G8YdcE_2395,2395.359,5.921,United States's reputation under this
qqG96G8YdcE_2397,2397.8,5.12,man's leadership is horrible including
qqG96G8YdcE_2401,2401.28,3.48,weaponization which I'm sure at some
qqG96G8YdcE_2402,2402.92,3.32,point you'll be talking about where he
qqG96G8YdcE_2404,2404.76,2.88,goes after his political opponent
qqG96G8YdcE_2406,2406.24,4.119,because he can't beat him fair and
qqG96G8YdcE_2407,2407.64,4.719,square you have 80 seconds left my
qqG96G8YdcE_2410,2410.359,4.121,question was what do you say to those
qqG96G8YdcE_2412,2412.359,3.801,voters who believe that you VI violated
qqG96G8YdcE_2414,2414.48,4.639,your constitutional oath through your
qqG96G8YdcE_2416,2416.16,4.52,actions in action on January 6 2021 and
qqG96G8YdcE_2419,2419.119,3.96,worry that you'll do it again well I
qqG96G8YdcE_2420,2420.68,4.919,didn't say that to anybody I said
qqG96G8YdcE_2423,2423.079,4.841,peacefully and patriotically and Nancy
qqG96G8YdcE_2425,2425.599,4.76,Pelosi if you just watched the news from
qqG96G8YdcE_2427,2427.92,5.919,two days ago on tape to her daughter
qqG96G8YdcE_2430,2430.359,5.681,who's a documentary filmmaker they say
qqG96G8YdcE_2433,2433.839,4.28,but she's saying oh no it's my
qqG96G8YdcE_2436,2436.04,4.039,responsibility I was responsible for

qqG96G8YdcE_2951,2951.16,6.159,both sides what American president would
qqG96G8YdcE_2954,2954.76,5.039,ever say Nazis coming out of fields
qqG96G8YdcE_2957,2957.319,5.8,carrying torches singing the same
qqG96G8YdcE_2959,2959.799,5.56,anti-semitic B carrying swastikas were
qqG96G8YdcE_2963,2963.119,4.321,fine people this is the guy who says
qqG96G8YdcE_2965,2965.359,3.72,Hitler's done some good things I like to
qqG96G8YdcE_2967,2967.44,3.56,know what they are the good things
qqG96G8YdcE_2969,2969.079,4.121,Hitler's done that's what he said this
qqG96G8YdcE_2971,2971.0,4.96,guy has no sense of American

qqG96G8YdcE_2975,2975.96,4.04,you know that story has been totally
qqG96G8YdcE_2978,2978.119,5.48,wiped out because when you see the
qqG96G8YdcE_2980,2980.0,5.04,sentence it said 100% exoneration on
qqG96G8YdcE_2983,2983.599,3.24,that so he just keeps it going he says
qqG96G8YdcE_2985,2985.04,3.519,he ran because of Charlottesville he
qqG96G8YdcE_2986,2986.839,4.441,didn't run because of Charlottesville he
qqG96G8YdcE_2988,2988.559,4.401,ran because it was his last chance it
qqG96G8YdcE_2991,2991.28,3.319,he's not equipped to be president you
qqG96G8YdcE_2992,2992.96,3.879,know it and I know it it's ridiculous we
qqG96G8YdcE_2994,2994.599,5.24,have a debate we're trying to justify
qqG96G8YdcE_2996,2996.839,5.841,his presidency his presidency he's
qqG96G8YdcE_2999,2999.839,4.681,without question the worst president the
qqG96G8YdcE_3002,3002.68,3.96,worst presidency in the history of our
qqG96G8YdcE_3004,3004.52,4.039,country we shouldn't be having a debate
qqG96G8YdcE_3006,3006.64,3.88,about it there's nothing to debate he
qqG96G8YdcE_3008,3008.559,3.881,made up the Charlottesville story and
qqG96G8YdcE_3010,3010.52,4.12,you'll see it's debunked all over the
qqG96G8YdcE_3012,3012.44,5.04,place every anchor has de every
qqG96G8YdcE_3014,3014.64,4.4,reasonable anchor has debunked it and
qqG96G8YdcE_3017,3017.48,5.24,just the other day it came out where it
qqG96G8YdcE_3019,3019.04,5.519,was fully debunked it's a nonsense story
qqG96G8YdcE_3022,3022.72,3.359,he knows that and he didn't run because
qqG96G8YdcE_3024,3024.559,3.401,of Charlottesville he used that as an
qqG96G8YdcE_3026,3026.079,4.76,excuse to run
qqG96G8YdcE_3027,3027.96,4.159,president bid and debunk it happened all
qqG96G8YdcE_3030,3030.839,4.081,you have to do is listen to what was
qqG96G8YdcE_3032,3032.119,4.801,said at the time and the idea that
qqG96G8YdcE_3034,3034.92,3.48,somehow that's the only reason I ran I
qqG96G8YdcE_3036,3036.92,3.679,ran because I was worried a guy like
qqG96G8YdcE_3038,3038.4,3.919,this guy could get elected if he thought
qqG96G8YdcE_3040,3040.599,4.0,they were good people coming out of that
qqG96G8YdcE_3042,3042.319,4.28,all that Forest carrying those those
qqG96G8YdcE_3044,3044.599,3.76,woods carrying those torches that he
qqG96G8YdcE_3046,3046.599,3.641,didn't deserve to be president didn't
qqG96G8YdcE_3048,3048.359,4.521,deserve to be president at all and the
qqG96G8YdcE_3050,3050.24,4.68,idea that he's talking about all this
qqG96G8YdcE_3052,3052.88,4.0,being fabricated we saw with our own
qqG96G8YdcE_3054,3054.92,3.399,eyes we saw what happened on January 6th
qqG96G8YdcE_3056,3056.88,4.12,we saw the people breaking through the
qqG96G8YdcE_3058,3058.319,4.721,windows we saw people occupying that his
qqG96G8YdcE_3061,3061.0,6.04,own vice president look there's a reason
qqG96G8YdcE_3063,3063.04,6.0,why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers
qqG96G8YdcE_3067,3067.04,3.519,refused to endorse him this time his
qqG96G8YdcE_3069,3069.04,4.64,vice president hasn't endorsed him this
qqG96G8YdcE_3070,3070.559,4.56,time so why why they know him well they
qqG96G8YdcE_3073,3073.68,3.72,serve with him why are they not

qqG96G8YdcE_3311,3311.48,4.48,about persistent challenges you both
qqG96G8YdcE_3313,3313.68,4.919,faced in your first terms and you'd
qqG96G8YdcE_3315,3315.96,5.359,certainly face again in a second term
qqG96G8YdcE_3318,3318.599,4.76,President Biden while black unemployment
qqG96G8YdcE_3321,3321.319,4.72,dropped to a record low under your
qqG96G8YdcE_3323,3323.359,5.401,presidency black families still earn far
qqG96G8YdcE_3326,3326.039,4.721,less less than white families black
qqG96G8YdcE_3328,3328.76,4.319,mothers are still three times more
qqG96G8YdcE_3330,3330.76,4.52,likely to die from pregnancy related
qqG96G8YdcE_3333,3333.079,4.96,causes and black Americans are
qqG96G8YdcE_3335,3335.28,5.2,imprisoned at five times the rate of
qqG96G8YdcE_3338,3338.039,4.481,white Americans what do you say to Black
qqG96G8YdcE_3340,3340.48,4.079,voters who are disappointed that you
qqG96G8YdcE_3342,3342.52,3.519,haven't made more progress they
qqG96G8YdcE_3344,3344.559,3.24,acknowledge they made a lot of progress
qqG96G8YdcE_3346,3346.039,3.921,number one the fact of the matter is
qqG96G8YdcE_3347,3347.799,4.52,there's more small black businesses that
qqG96G8YdcE_3349,3349.96,4.96,have been started in any time in history
qqG96G8YdcE_3352,3352.319,4.28,number two the wages of black their
qqG96G8YdcE_3354,3354.92,4.0,black unemployment is the lowest level
qqG96G8YdcE_3356,3356.599,5.321,has been in a long long time number
qqG96G8YdcE_3358,3358.92,5.96,three we find find providing housing for
qqG96G8YdcE_3361,3361.92,6.24,black Americans and dealing with the
qqG96G8YdcE_3364,3364.88,5.6,segregation that exists among these
qqG96G8YdcE_3368,3368.16,4.639,corporate these corporate rations that
qqG96G8YdcE_3370,3370.48,5.2,collude to keep people out of their
qqG96G8YdcE_3372,3372.799,9.76,houses and in addition to that we find
qqG96G8YdcE_3375,3375.68,8.399,that the impact of on the the choice
qqG96G8YdcE_3382,3382.559,4.8,that black families have to make
qqG96G8YdcE_3384,3384.079,5.081,relative to child care is a incredibly
qqG96G8YdcE_3387,3387.359,3.801,difficult when we did the first major
qqG96G8YdcE_3389,3389.16,5.8,piece of legislation in the past I was
qqG96G8YdcE_3391,3391.16,6.52,able to reduce black child care costs I
qqG96G8YdcE_3394,3394.96,5.0,cut them in half in half we got to make
qqG96G8YdcE_3397,3397.68,3.76,sure we provide for child care cost we
qqG96G8YdcE_3399,3399.96,3.839,got to make sure because when you
qqG96G8YdcE_3401,3401.44,4.72,provide that child care protections you
qqG96G8YdcE_3403,3403.799,4.841,in increase economic growth because more
qqG96G8YdcE_3406,3406.16,4.8,people can be in the in the job market
qqG96G8YdcE_3408,3408.64,4.52,so there's more to be done considerably
qqG96G8YdcE_3410,3410.96,3.96,more to be done but we've done a great
qqG96G8YdcE_3413,3413.16,5.52,deal so far and I'm not letting up and
qqG96G8YdcE_3414,3414.92,6.28,they know it you have 49 seconds left
qqG96G8YdcE_3418,3418.68,4.72,what do you say to Black voters who are
qqG96G8YdcE_3421,3421.2,3.399,disappointed with the progress so far I
qqG96G8YdcE_3423,3423.4,3.28,say I don't blame them for being
qqG96G8YdcE_3424,3424.599,4.52,disappointed inflation is still hurting
qqG96G8YdcE_3426,3426.68,6.08,them badly for example I provided for
qqG96G8YdcE_3429,3429.119,5.641,the idea that any black family firsttime
qqG96G8YdcE_3432,3432.76,3.88,"home buyer should get a $10,000 tax"
qqG96G8YdcE_3434,3434.76,4.76,credit to be able to buy their first
qqG96G8YdcE_3436,3436.64,4.679,home so they can get started I made sure
qqG96G8YdcE_3439,3439.52,3.279,that we're in a situation where all
qqG96G8YdcE_3441,3441.319,4.0,those black families and those black
qqG96G8YdcE_3442,3442.799,5.52,individuals who provided had to take out
qqG96G8YdcE_3445,3445.319,6.0,student loans that were ballooning that
qqG96G8YdcE_3448,3448.319,5.48,if they were engaged in nursing doctor
qqG96G8YdcE_3451,3451.319,4.561,and any anything having to do with
qqG96G8YdcE_3453,3453.799,4.921,volunteerism if they paid their bills
qqG96G8YdcE_3455,3455.88,4.919,for 10 years on their student debt all
qqG96G8YdcE_3458,3458.72,4.16,the rest is Forgiven after 10 years
qqG96G8YdcE_3460,3460.799,4.201,Millions have benefited from that and
qqG96G8YdcE_3462,3462.88,4.919,we're going to do a whole lot more for
qqG96G8YdcE_3465,3465.0,5.119,black families thank you president Trump
qqG96G8YdcE_3467,3467.799,4.52,and he caused the inflation he's blaming
qqG96G8YdcE_3470,3470.119,4.641,inflation and he's right it's been very
qqG96G8YdcE_3472,3472.319,4.48,bad he caused the inflation and it's
qqG96G8YdcE_3474,3474.76,4.319,killing black families and Hispanic
qqG96G8YdcE_3476,3476.799,4.641,families and just about everybody it's
qqG96G8YdcE_3479,3479.079,4.361,killing people they can't buy groceries
qqG96G8YdcE_3481,3481.44,4.2,anymore they can't you look at the cost
qqG96G8YdcE_3483,3483.44,4.72,of food where it's doubled and tripled
qqG96G8YdcE_3485,3485.64,5.04,and quadrupled they can't live they're
qqG96G8YdcE_3488,3488.16,5.76,not living anymore he caused this
qqG96G8YdcE_3490,3490.68,5.52,inflation I gave him a country with no
qqG96G8YdcE_3493,3493.92,3.84,essentially no inflation it was perfect
qqG96G8YdcE_3496,3496.2,4.28,it was so good all he had to do is leave
qqG96G8YdcE_3497,3497.76,4.92,it alone he destroyed it with his green
qqG96G8YdcE_3500,3500.48,4.28,new scam and all of the other all this
qqG96G8YdcE_3502,3502.68,4.359,money that's being thrown out the window
qqG96G8YdcE_3504,3504.76,6.16,he caused inflation as sure as you're
qqG96G8YdcE_3507,3507.039,6.841,sitting there the fact is that his big
qqG96G8YdcE_3510,3510.92,4.56,kill on the black people is the millions
qqG96G8YdcE_3513,3513.88,3.159,of people that he's allowed to come in
qqG96G8YdcE_3515,3515.48,4.68,through the Border they're taking black
qqG96G8YdcE_3517,3517.039,5.56,jobs now and it could be 18 it could be
qqG96G8YdcE_3520,3520.16,4.439,19 and even 20 million people they're
qqG96G8YdcE_3522,3522.599,4.0,taking black jobs and they're taking
qqG96G8YdcE_3524,3524.599,3.601,Hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it
qqG96G8YdcE_3526,3526.599,3.161,yet but you're going to see something
qqG96G8YdcE_3528,3528.2,4.399,that's going to be the worst in our

qqG96G8YdcE_3609,3609.24,4.92,extreme heat intensifying wildfires
qqG96G8YdcE_3612,3612.359,4.24,stronger hurricanes and rising sea

qqG96G8YdcE_3622,3622.0,4.28,as president to slow the climate crisis
qqG96G8YdcE_3624,3624.48,4.839,well let me just go back to what he said

qqG96G8YdcE_3637,3637.359,5.041,police group and what he's done to the
qqG96G8YdcE_3639,3639.64,4.159,black population is horrible including
qqG96G8YdcE_3642,3642.4,3.0,the fact that for 10 years he called
qqG96G8YdcE_3643,3643.799,3.8,them super Predators we can't in the
qqG96G8YdcE_3645,3645.4,4.28,1990s we can't forget that super

qqG96G8YdcE_3651,3651.2,3.48,offense at it and now they see it
qqG96G8YdcE_3652,3652.68,4.52,happening but when they see what I did
qqG96G8YdcE_3654,3654.68,5.04,for criminal justice form and for the
qqG96G8YdcE_3657,3657.2,4.68,historically black uh colleges and
qqG96G8YdcE_3659,3659.72,4.639,universities where I funded them and got

qqG96G8YdcE_3671,3671.559,2.721,came to me with the idea and it was a
qqG96G8YdcE_3673,3673.079,3.561,great idea it's one of the most
qqG96G8YdcE_3674,3674.28,4.92,successful Economic Development acts
qqG96G8YdcE_3676,3676.64,4.8,ever in the country opportunity zones

qqG96G8YdcE_3681,3681.44,5.56,and that's why we have the best numbers
qqG96G8YdcE_3684,3684.24,4.64,with them in maybe ever they're saying

qqG96G8YdcE_3692,3692.599,4.52,population because he's done a horrible
qqG96G8YdcE_3694,3694.92,4.879,job for black people he's also done a
qqG96G8YdcE_3697,3697.119,4.761,horrible job for Hispanics but way do
qqG96G8YdcE_3699,3699.799,3.24,you see these millions of people pouring
qqG96G8YdcE_3701,3701.88,3.439,into our country and they're going to
qqG96G8YdcE_3703,3703.039,4.28,take the jobs and it's already started
qqG96G8YdcE_3705,3705.319,4.921,and you haven't seen anything yet it's a
qqG96G8YdcE_3707,3707.319,5.161,disaster you've 38 seconds left

qqG96G8YdcE_3725,3725.2,6.919,numbers ever and we did we were using
qqG96G8YdcE_3729,3729.24,5.64,all forms of energy all forms everything
qqG96G8YdcE_3732,3732.119,6.16,and yet during my four years I had the
qqG96G8YdcE_3734,3734.88,5.159,best environmental numbers ever and my
qqG96G8YdcE_3738,3738.279,3.401,top environmental people gave me that
qqG96G8YdcE_3740,3740.039,3.201,statistic just before I walked on the
qqG96G8YdcE_3741,3741.68,3.439,stage
qqG96G8YdcE_3743,3743.24,3.2,actually I don't know where the hell
qqG96G8YdcE_3745,3745.119,4.96,he's been
qqG96G8YdcE_3746,3746.44,6.48,the idea that a he said is true I've
qqG96G8YdcE_3750,3750.079,5.801,passed the most extensive most extensive
qqG96G8YdcE_3752,3752.92,5.6,climate change legislation in history in
qqG96G8YdcE_3755,3755.88,5.439,history we find ourselves and by the way
qqG96G8YdcE_3758,3758.52,5.039,black colleges I I came up with $50
qqG96G8YdcE_3761,3761.319,4.201,billion for HBCU historic black
qqG96G8YdcE_3763,3763.559,4.401,universities and colleges because they
qqG96G8YdcE_3765,3765.52,5.319,don't have they don't have the kind of
qqG96G8YdcE_3767,3767.96,4.96,contributors that they have to build
qqG96G8YdcE_3770,3770.839,3.72,these Laboratories and the like any
qqG96G8YdcE_3772,3772.92,3.399,black student is capable in College of
qqG96G8YdcE_3774,3774.559,3.081,doing what any white student can do they
qqG96G8YdcE_3776,3776.319,3.841,just have the money but now they'll be
qqG96G8YdcE_3777,3777.64,5.08,able to get those jobs in high-tech
qqG96G8YdcE_3780,3780.16,5.879,we're in a situation where the idea that
qqG96G8YdcE_3782,3782.72,5.879,he is claiming to have done something
qqG96G8YdcE_3786,3786.039,4.76,that had the cleanest water the cleanest
qqG96G8YdcE_3788,3788.599,4.281,water he hadn't done a damn thing in the
qqG96G8YdcE_3790,3790.799,4.441,environment he pulled out of the Paris
qqG96G8YdcE_3792,3792.88,4.919,peace Accord climate Accord I
qqG96G8YdcE_3795,3795.24,5.44,immediately joined it because if we re H
qqG96G8YdcE_3797,3797.799,4.881,1.5 degrees C at anyone point where
qqG96G8YdcE_3800,3800.68,4.359,there's no way back the only existential
qqG96G8YdcE_3802,3802.68,4.04,threat to humanity is climate change and
qqG96G8YdcE_3805,3805.039,3.56,he didn't do a dam Dam thing about it he
qqG96G8YdcE_3806,3806.72,4.68,must undo all that I've
qqG96G8YdcE_3808,3808.599,5.48,done the Paris Accord was going to cost
qqG96G8YdcE_3811,3811.4,5.159,us a trillion dollars and China nothing
qqG96G8YdcE_3814,3814.079,5.681,and Russia nothing and India nothing it
qqG96G8YdcE_3816,3816.559,5.361,was a ripoff of the United States and I
qqG96G8YdcE_3819,3819.76,3.48,ended it because I didn't want to waste
qqG96G8YdcE_3821,3821.92,2.879,that money because they treated us
qqG96G8YdcE_3823,3823.24,3.28,horribly we were the only ones it was
qqG96G8YdcE_3824,3824.799,4.76,costing us money nobody else was paying
qqG96G8YdcE_3826,3826.52,4.799,into it and it was a it was a disaster
qqG96G8YdcE_3829,3829.559,3.081,but everything that he said just now
qqG96G8YdcE_3831,3831.319,3.441,I'll give you an example I heard him say
qqG96G8YdcE_3832,3832.64,4.479,before insulin I'm the one that got the
qqG96G8YdcE_3834,3834.76,4.44,insulin down for the seniors I took care
qqG96G8YdcE_3837,3837.119,4.281,of the seniors what he's doing is
qqG96G8YdcE_3839,3839.2,4.56,destroying all of our medical programs
qqG96G8YdcE_3841,3841.4,4.48,because the migrants coming in they want
qqG96G8YdcE_3843,3843.76,3.76,everybody and look I have the I have the
qqG96G8YdcE_3845,3845.88,3.439,biggest heart on the stage I guarantee
qqG96G8YdcE_3847,3847.52,3.92,you that and I want to take care of
qqG96G8YdcE_3849,3849.319,3.921,people but we're destroying our country
qqG96G8YdcE_3851,3851.44,3.359,they're taking over our schools our
qqG96G8YdcE_3853,3853.24,4.119,hospitals and they're going to be taking
qqG96G8YdcE_3854,3854.799,6.52,over Social Security he is destroying
qqG96G8YdcE_3857,3857.359,3.96,Social Security Medicare and
qqG96G8YdcE_3862,3862.48,6.2,Medicaid the idea is that we in fact
qqG96G8YdcE_3865,3865.839,5.2,fact we were the only ones of
qqG96G8YdcE_3868,3868.68,4.84,consequence who were not who were not
qqG96G8YdcE_3871,3871.039,4.681,members of of the Paris Accord how can
qqG96G8YdcE_3873,3873.52,4.559,we do anything we've not able the United
qqG96G8YdcE_3875,3875.72,4.24,States can't get his under control one
qqG96G8YdcE_3878,3878.079,3.801,of the largest polluters in the world
qqG96G8YdcE_3879,3879.96,4.56,number one we're making significant
qqG96G8YdcE_3881,3881.88,5.08,progress by 2035 we will have cut
qqG96G8YdcE_3884,3884.52,4.519,pollution in half we have made we've
qqG96G8YdcE_3886,3886.96,3.96,made significant progress and we're
qqG96G8YdcE_3889,3889.039,3.961,continue to make progress we set up a
qqG96G8YdcE_3890,3890.92,3.919,climate Corp where thousands of young
qqG96G8YdcE_3893,3893.0,3.88,people will learn how to deal with clim
qqG96G8YdcE_3894,3894.839,3.881,just like the people core and we're
qqG96G8YdcE_3896,3896.88,3.76,going to we're moving in directions that
qqG96G8YdcE_3898,3898.72,4.359,are going to significantly change the
qqG96G8YdcE_3900,3900.64,5.639,elements of cause of pollution but the
qqG96G8YdcE_3903,3903.079,4.641,idea that he claims that he has the
qqG96G8YdcE_3906,3906.279,4.681,biggest heart up here and he's really
qqG96G8YdcE_3907,3907.72,5.399,concerned about about pollution and
qqG96G8YdcE_3910,3910.96,4.639,about climate I've not seen any
qqG96G8YdcE_3913,3913.119,6.68,indication of that and by the way with
qqG96G8YdcE_3915,3915.599,6.0,regard to prescription drugs one company
qqG96G8YdcE_3919,3919.799,4.641,agreed that they would reduce the price
qqG96G8YdcE_3921,3921.599,5.561,to $35 which I was calling for one
qqG96G8YdcE_3924,3924.44,4.879,voluntarily I made sure every company in
qqG96G8YdcE_3927,3927.16,5.28,the world every pharmaceutical company
qqG96G8YdcE_3929,3929.319,6.081,cannot have to pay and by the
qqG96G8YdcE_3932,3932.44,5.119,way so every day millions of Americans
qqG96G8YdcE_3935,3935.4,4.52,struggle just to make ends meet for many
qqG96G8YdcE_3937,3937.559,4.72,older Americans Social Security provides
qqG96G8YdcE_3939,3939.92,4.399,a critical Lifeline President Biden if
qqG96G8YdcE_3942,3942.279,5.0,nothing is done to Social Security
qqG96G8YdcE_3944,3944.319,5.881,seniors will see their benefits cut in
qqG96G8YdcE_3947,3947.279,4.921,just over 10 years will you name tonight
qqG96G8YdcE_3950,3950.2,4.639,one specific step that you're willing to
qqG96G8YdcE_3952,3952.2,4.119,take to keep Social Security solvent yes
qqG96G8YdcE_3954,3954.839,4.561,make the very wealth they began to pay
qqG96G8YdcE_3956,3956.319,6.76,their fair share right now everybody
qqG96G8YdcE_3959,3959.4,6.08,"making under $170,000 pays 6% of their"
qqG96G8YdcE_3963,3963.079,3.76,income of their paycheck every single
qqG96G8YdcE_3965,3965.48,3.2,time they get a paycheck from the time
qqG96G8YdcE_3966,3966.839,4.401,the first one they get when they're 18
qqG96G8YdcE_3968,3968.68,5.399,years old the idea that they're gon to
qqG96G8YdcE_3971,3971.24,7.64,I'm not I been proposing that everybody
qqG96G8YdcE_3974,3974.079,7.601,they pay the millionaires pay 1% 1% so
qqG96G8YdcE_3978,3978.88,4.8,no one after I would not raise the cost
qqG96G8YdcE_3981,3981.68,4.159,of social security for anybody under
qqG96G8YdcE_3983,3983.68,4.679,"$400,000 after that I began the make the"
qqG96G8YdcE_3985,3985.839,5.401,wealthy begin to pay their fair share by
qqG96G8YdcE_3988,3988.359,5.361,increasing from 1% Beyond to be able to
qqG96G8YdcE_3991,3991.24,4.44,guarantee the program for life so you
qqG96G8YdcE_3993,3993.72,3.319,still have 82 seconds left are there any
qqG96G8YdcE_3995,3995.68,3.399,other measures that you think that would
qqG96G8YdcE_3997,3997.039,4.161,be able to help keep Social Security
qqG96G8YdcE_3999,3999.079,3.641,solvent or is just is that one enough
qqG96G8YdcE_4001,4001.2,3.8,well no that that one enough will keep
qqG96G8YdcE_4002,4002.72,4.599,it solvent but the biggest thing I'll do
qqG96G8YdcE_4005,4005.0,4.44,if we defeat this man because he wants
qqG96G8YdcE_4007,4007.319,4.0,to get rid of Social Security he thinks
qqG96G8YdcE_4009,4009.44,3.359,there's plenty to cut in Social Security
qqG96G8YdcE_4011,4011.319,4.0,he's wanted to cut Social Security and
qqG96G8YdcE_4012,4012.799,4.76,Medicare both times and that's what and
qqG96G8YdcE_4015,4015.319,5.161,if look at the the program put forward
qqG96G8YdcE_4017,4017.559,5.601,by the house Republican caucus that he I
qqG96G8YdcE_4020,4020.48,5.72,believe supports is in fact want to cut
qqG96G8YdcE_4023,4023.16,6.159,it as well the idea that we don't need
qqG96G8YdcE_4026,4026.2,6.079,to protect our seniors is ridiculous we
qqG96G8YdcE_4029,4029.319,4.76,put we and by the way American public
qqG96G8YdcE_4032,4032.279,4.56,has greater Health Care coverage today
qqG96G8YdcE_4034,4034.079,5.561,than ever before and under the ACA as I
qqG96G8YdcE_4036,4036.839,6.081,said you're in a circumstance where
qqG96G8YdcE_4039,4039.64,5.12,"400,000 people 4 I mean 40 million"
qqG96G8YdcE_4042,4042.92,3.919,people would not have insurance because
qqG96G8YdcE_4044,4044.76,4.2,they have a pre-existing condition only
qqG96G8YdcE_4046,4046.839,4.401,allows them to have that insurance is
qqG96G8YdcE_4048,4048.96,4.96,the fact that they in fact are part of
qqG96G8YdcE_4051,4051.24,4.599,the ACA and by the way the other thing
qqG96G8YdcE_4053,4053.92,4.359,is we're in a situation where I talk
qqG96G8YdcE_4055,4055.839,5.161,about education for black communities
qqG96G8YdcE_4058,4058.279,5.481,I've raised the number the amount of
qqG96G8YdcE_4061,4061.0,5.52,"money for pel Grants another $8,000 so"
qqG96G8YdcE_4063,4063.76,5.519,"anybody making under $70,000 a year"
qqG96G8YdcE_4066,4066.52,5.519,"going to be able to get $115,000 toward"
qqG96G8YdcE_4069,4069.279,4.121,the tuition it's he he just doesn't know
qqG96G8YdcE_4072,4072.039,3.08,what he's talking about thank you
qqG96G8YdcE_4073,4073.4,2.639,President Biden president Trump so I've
qqG96G8YdcE_4075,4075.119,3.44,dealt with
qqG96G8YdcE_4076,4076.039,5.32,politicians all my life I've been on
qqG96G8YdcE_4078,4078.559,5.8,this side of the equation for the last
qqG96G8YdcE_4081,4081.359,5.2,eight years uh I've never seen anybody
qqG96G8YdcE_4084,4084.359,4.361,lie like this guy he lies I've never
qqG96G8YdcE_4086,4086.559,4.921,seen it he could look you in the face so
qqG96G8YdcE_4088,4088.72,4.52,about so many other things too and we
qqG96G8YdcE_4091,4091.48,4.119,mentioned the laptop we mentioned Russia
qqG96G8YdcE_4093,4093.24,4.519,Russia Russia Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine
qqG96G8YdcE_4095,4095.599,4.12,everything he does is a lie it's

qqG96G8YdcE_4205,4205.12,3.68,address this issue but the average cost
qqG96G8YdcE_4207,4207.28,4.439,of child care in this country has risen
qqG96G8YdcE_4208,4208.8,5.439,"to more than $1,000 a year per child for"
qqG96G8YdcE_4211,4211.719,5.48,many families the cost of child care for
qqG96G8YdcE_4214,4214.239,4.841,two children is more than their rent in
qqG96G8YdcE_4217,4217.199,4.081,your second term what would you do to
qqG96G8YdcE_4219,4219.08,5.04,make child care more

qqG96G8YdcE_4288,4288.4,4.08,destroyed as you and I sit up here and
qqG96G8YdcE_4290,4290.4,4.16,waste a lot of time on this debate this
qqG96G8YdcE_4292,4292.48,3.64,shouldn't be a debate he is the worst
qqG96G8YdcE_4294,4294.56,4.24,president he just said it about me
qqG96G8YdcE_4296,4296.12,4.28,because I said it uh but look he's the
qqG96G8YdcE_4298,4298.8,3.96,worst president in the history of our
qqG96G8YdcE_4300,4300.4,3.52,country he's destroyed our country now
qqG96G8YdcE_4302,4302.76,2.68,all of a sudden he's trying to get a
qqG96G8YdcE_4303,4303.92,4.36,little tough on the border he come out
qqG96G8YdcE_4305,4305.44,4.84,came out with a a nothing a nothing deal
qqG96G8YdcE_4308,4308.28,5.28,and it reduced it a little bit a little
qqG96G8YdcE_4310,4310.28,5.359,bit like this much it's insignificant he
qqG96G8YdcE_4313,4313.56,3.92,wants open borders he wants wants our
qqG96G8YdcE_4315,4315.639,4.921,country to either be destroyed or he

qqG96G8YdcE_4320,4320.56,5.52,and I don't think we just can't let it
qqG96G8YdcE_4322,4322.88,5.56,happen if he wins this election our
qqG96G8YdcE_4326,4326.08,5.44,country doesn't have a chance not even a
qqG96G8YdcE_4328,4328.44,4.719,chance of coming out of this rut we
qqG96G8YdcE_4331,4331.52,3.56,probably won't have a country left
qqG96G8YdcE_4333,4333.159,4.241,anymore that's how bad it is he is the

qqG96G8YdcE_4389,4389.44,3.719,should significantly increase the child
qqG96G8YdcE_4391,4391.08,4.639,care tax credit we should significantly
qqG96G8YdcE_4393,4393.159,5.04,increase the availability of women and

qqG96G8YdcE_4694,4694.32,3.6,and it costs a lot of money that was
qqG96G8YdcE_4696,4696.12,4.84,part of this deal we put together this
qqG96G8YdcE_4697,4697.92,5.96,bipartisan deal more fentanyl machines

qqG96G8YdcE_4756,4756.84,3.92,negotiations with Mexico and I got it
qqG96G8YdcE_4758,4758.639,4.121,all for nothing it's just like when you
qqG96G8YdcE_4760,4760.76,3.68,have a hostage we always pay $6 billion

qqG96G8YdcE_4772,4772.84,4.96,laughing at this guy probably asking for
qqG96G8YdcE_4774,4774.639,6.241,billions of dollars for the reporter I
qqG96G8YdcE_4777,4777.8,5.48,will have him out very quickly as soon

qqG96G8YdcE_4790,4790.28,3.919,ago but Putin's probably asking for
qqG96G8YdcE_4792,4792.4,4.239,billions and billions of dollars because

qqG96G8YdcE_4816,4816.4,4.6,your capability to handle the toughest
qqG96G8YdcE_4818,4818.52,5.92,job in the world well into your
qqG96G8YdcE_4821,4821.0,6.08,80s well first of all I spent half my
qqG96G8YdcE_4824,4824.44,5.08,care being being criticized being the
qqG96G8YdcE_4827,4827.08,4.48,youngest person in politics I was the
qqG96G8YdcE_4829,4829.52,3.88,second youngest person ever elected the
qqG96G8YdcE_4831,4831.56,3.84,United States Senate and now I'm the

qqG96G8YdcE_4835,4835.4,3.64,and a lot less competent I think that
qqG96G8YdcE_4837,4837.639,2.721,just look at the record look at what
qqG96G8YdcE_4839,4839.04,3.88,I've done look how I've turned around
qqG96G8YdcE_4840,4840.36,5.04,the horrible situation he left me as I
qqG96G8YdcE_4842,4842.92,4.6,"said 15 million new jobs 800,000"
qqG96G8YdcE_4845,4845.4,4.759,manufacturing jobs more investment in

qqG96G8YdcE_4862,4862.36,4.96,invented those chips and we lost it
qqG96G8YdcE_4865,4865.04,4.639,because he was sending people to cheap
qqG96G8YdcE_4867,4867.32,5.08,to find the cheapest jobs overseas and

qqG96G8YdcE_4888,4888.32,4.52,and there's billions about $40 billion
qqG96G8YdcE_4891,4891.199,3.841,already being invested and being built
qqG96G8YdcE_4892,4892.84,4.56,right now in the United States creating

qqG96G8YdcE_5045,5045.239,5.321,I'm happy to play golf if you carry your
qqG96G8YdcE_5046,5046.88,5.759,own bag think you can do it that's the
qqG96G8YdcE_5050,5050.56,5.599,biggest lie that he's a six- handicap of
qqG96G8YdcE_5052,5052.639,6.121,all I was an eight handicap yeah
qqG96G8YdcE_5056,5056.159,5.441,eight but I have you know how many I've
qqG96G8YdcE_5058,5058.76,3.919,seen you swing I know you swing not act
qqG96G8YdcE_5061,5061.6,4.2,like children president Trump we're
qqG96G8YdcE_5062,5062.679,5.52,going to let's not act like
qqG96G8YdcE_5065,5065.8,5.68,a specific concern that voters have
qqG96G8YdcE_5068,5068.199,5.241,about you will you pledge tonight that
qqG96G8YdcE_5071,5071.48,4.759,once all legal challenges have been
qqG96G8YdcE_5073,5073.44,4.719,exhausted that you will accept the
qqG96G8YdcE_5076,5076.239,5.521,results of this election regardless of
qqG96G8YdcE_5078,5078.159,6.161,who wins and you will say right now that
qqG96G8YdcE_5081,5081.76,4.479,political violence in any form is
qqG96G8YdcE_5084,5084.32,3.96,unacceptable well I shouldn't have to
qqG96G8YdcE_5086,5086.239,4.48,say that but of course I believe that
qqG96G8YdcE_5088,5088.28,4.04,it's totally unacceptable and if you
qqG96G8YdcE_5090,5090.719,3.681,would see my statements that I made on
qqG96G8YdcE_5092,5092.32,3.52,Twitter at the time and also my
qqG96G8YdcE_5094,5094.4,2.92,statement that I made in the Rose guard
qqG96G8YdcE_5095,5095.84,3.0,you would say it's one of the strongest
qqG96G8YdcE_5097,5097.32,3.6,statements you've ever seen in addition
qqG96G8YdcE_5098,5098.84,3.6,to the speech I made in front of I
qqG96G8YdcE_5100,5100.92,3.56,believe the largest crowd I've ever
qqG96G8YdcE_5102,5102.44,4.279,spoken to and I will tell you nobody
qqG96G8YdcE_5104,5104.48,3.84,ever talks about that they talk about a
qqG96G8YdcE_5106,5106.719,3.92,relatively small number of people that
qqG96G8YdcE_5108,5108.32,4.28,went to the capital and in many cases
qqG96G8YdcE_5110,5110.639,3.961,were ushered in by the police and as
qqG96G8YdcE_5112,5112.6,4.0,Nancy Pelosi said it was her
qqG96G8YdcE_5114,5114.6,5.039,responsibility not mine she said that
qqG96G8YdcE_5116,5116.6,5.119,loud and clear but the answer is uh if
qqG96G8YdcE_5119,5119.639,4.281,the election is fair free and I want
qqG96G8YdcE_5121,5121.719,3.561,that more than anybody and I'll tell you
qqG96G8YdcE_5123,5123.92,3.16,something
qqG96G8YdcE_5125,5125.28,4.16,I wish he was a great president because
qqG96G8YdcE_5127,5127.08,5.36,I wouldn't be here right now I'd be at

qqG96G8YdcE_5132,5132.44,3.239,wouldn't be under indictment because I
qqG96G8YdcE_5134,5134.04,4.96,wouldn't have been his political appoint
qqG96G8YdcE_5135,5135.679,5.56,you know opponent because he indicted me
qqG96G8YdcE_5139,5139.0,4.56,because I was his opponent I wish he was
qqG96G8YdcE_5141,5141.239,4.721,a great president I would rather have
qqG96G8YdcE_5143,5143.56,4.0,that I wouldn't be here I don't mind
qqG96G8YdcE_5145,5145.96,4.08,being here but the only reason I'm here
qqG96G8YdcE_5147,5147.56,4.28,is he's so bad as a president that I'm

qqG96G8YdcE_5244,5244.32,5.24,president Trump as I come back to you
qqG96G8YdcE_5245,5245.92,5.96,for a followup the question was will you

qqG96G8YdcE_5251,5251.88,6.72,regardless of who wins just to finish
qqG96G8YdcE_5254,5254.8,6.359,what he said if I might uh Russia they
qqG96G8YdcE_5258,5258.6,5.92,took a lot of land from Bush they took a
qqG96G8YdcE_5261,5261.159,6.241,lot of land from Obama and Biden they
qqG96G8YdcE_5264,5264.52,5.159,took no land nothing from Trump nothing
qqG96G8YdcE_5267,5267.4,3.96,he knew not to do it he's not going to
qqG96G8YdcE_5269,5269.679,3.161,play games with me he knew that I got
qqG96G8YdcE_5271,5271.36,4.2,along with him very well but he knew not
qqG96G8YdcE_5272,5272.84,5.12,to play games he took nothing from
qqG96G8YdcE_5275,5275.56,5.599,me but now he's going to take the whole
qqG96G8YdcE_5277,5277.96,4.8,thing from this man right here that's a
qqG96G8YdcE_5281,5281.159,5.121,war that should have never started it
qqG96G8YdcE_5282,5282.76,6.32,would have never started ever with me
qqG96G8YdcE_5286,5286.28,4.16,and he's going to take Ukraine and you
qqG96G8YdcE_5289,5289.08,3.2,know you asked me a question before
qqG96G8YdcE_5290,5290.44,4.279,would you do this would he's got us in
qqG96G8YdcE_5292,5292.28,5.08,such a bad position right now with with
qqG96G8YdcE_5294,5294.719,4.801,Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine's not
qqG96G8YdcE_5297,5297.36,4.2,winning that war he said I will never
qqG96G8YdcE_5299,5299.52,3.199,settle until such time they're running
qqG96G8YdcE_5301,5301.56,2.599,out of people they're running out of
qqG96G8YdcE_5302,5302.719,4.201,soldiers they've lost so many people
qqG96G8YdcE_5304,5304.159,4.641,people it's so sad they've lost so many
qqG96G8YdcE_5306,5306.92,3.84,people and they've lost those gorgeous
qqG96G8YdcE_5308,5308.8,4.399,cities with the golden domes that are a
qqG96G8YdcE_5310,5310.76,4.84,thousand years old all because of him
qqG96G8YdcE_5313,5313.199,5.081,and stupid decisions Russia would have
qqG96G8YdcE_5315,5315.6,4.639,never attacked if I presid the question
qqG96G8YdcE_5318,5318.28,4.56,was will you accept the results of the
qqG96G8YdcE_5320,5320.239,5.841,election regardless of who wins yes or
qqG96G8YdcE_5322,5322.84,6.08,no please if it's a fair and legal and
qqG96G8YdcE_5326,5326.08,6.039,good election absolutely I would have
qqG96G8YdcE_5328,5328.92,6.279,much rather accepted these but the the
qqG96G8YdcE_5332,5332.119,4.321,fraud and everything else was ridiculous
qqG96G8YdcE_5335,5335.199,3.321,and if you want we'll have a news
qqG96G8YdcE_5336,5336.44,5.16,conference on it in a week or we'll have
qqG96G8YdcE_5338,5338.52,5.48,another one of these on in a week but I
qqG96G8YdcE_5341,5341.6,4.44,will absolutely there's nothing I'd
qqG96G8YdcE_5344,5344.0,5.639,rather do it would be much easier for me
qqG96G8YdcE_5346,5346.04,6.36,to do that then I'm running again I
qqG96G8YdcE_5349,5349.639,5.161,wasn't really going to run until I saw
qqG96G8YdcE_5352,5352.4,4.839,the horrible job he did he's destroying
qqG96G8YdcE_5354,5354.8,4.64,our country I would be very happy to be
qqG96G8YdcE_5357,5357.239,5.641,someplace else in a nice location
qqG96G8YdcE_5359,5359.44,5.279,someplace and again no indictments no
qqG96G8YdcE_5362,5362.88,3.799,political opponent stuff because it's
qqG96G8YdcE_5364,5364.719,3.92,the only way he thinks he can win but
qqG96G8YdcE_5366,5366.679,4.201,unfortunately it's driven up by numbers
qqG96G8YdcE_5368,5368.639,4.721,and driven up up to a very high level
qqG96G8YdcE_5370,5370.88,4.04,because the people understand it let's
qqG96G8YdcE_5373,5373.36,4.08,see what your numbers are when this
qqG96G8YdcE_5374,5374.92,4.759,election is over let's see let's see
qqG96G8YdcE_5377,5377.44,4.759,you're a whiner when you lost the first
qqG96G8YdcE_5379,5379.679,4.0,time you you continued you appealed and
qqG96G8YdcE_5382,5382.199,5.161,appealed to courts all across the
qqG96G8YdcE_5383,5383.679,6.401,country not one single Court in America
qqG96G8YdcE_5387,5387.36,6.12,said any of your claims had any Merit
qqG96G8YdcE_5390,5390.08,4.639,state or local none but you continue to
qqG96G8YdcE_5393,5393.48,4.28,provoke
qqG96G8YdcE_5394,5394.719,5.161,this lie about somehow there's all this
qqG96G8YdcE_5397,5397.76,4.68,misrepresentation all this stealing
qqG96G8YdcE_5399,5399.88,4.48,there is no evidence of that at all and
qqG96G8YdcE_5402,5402.44,4.0,I tell you what I doubt whether you'll
qqG96G8YdcE_5404,5404.36,4.16,accept it because you're such a whiner
qqG96G8YdcE_5406,5406.44,4.0,the idea if you lose again you accepted
qqG96G8YdcE_5408,5408.52,3.36,anything you can't stand the loss
qqG96G8YdcE_5410,5410.44,2.52,something snapped in you in your loss
qqG96G8YdcE_5411,5411.88,4.72,the last
qqG96G8YdcE_5412,5412.96,8.48,time we'll be right back with more from
qqG96G8YdcE_5416,5416.6,4.84,the CNN presidential debate live from

qqG96G8YdcE_5641,5641.239,4.241,deliver their closing statements as
qqG96G8YdcE_5643,5643.28,4.399,predetermined by a coin toss we're going
qqG96G8YdcE_5645,5645.48,4.6,to begin with you President Biden you
qqG96G8YdcE_5647,5647.679,2.401,have two
qqG96G8YdcE_5650,5650.679,6.121,minutes we've made significant progress
qqG96G8YdcE_5654,5654.159,6.281,from the debacle that was left by
qqG96G8YdcE_5656,5656.8,5.6,President Trump and in in his last term
qqG96G8YdcE_5660,5660.44,4.56,we find ourselves in a situation where
qqG96G8YdcE_5662,5662.4,5.279,number one we have to make sure that we
qqG96G8YdcE_5665,5665.0,4.639,have a fair tax system I ask anyone out
qqG96G8YdcE_5667,5667.679,3.721,there in the audience or anyone out
qqG96G8YdcE_5669,5669.639,4.761,watching this debate do you think the
qqG96G8YdcE_5671,5671.4,5.96,tax system is fair the fact is that I
qqG96G8YdcE_5674,5674.4,5.0,"said nobody even making under $400,000"
qqG96G8YdcE_5677,5677.36,4.52,had a single penny increase in their
qqG96G8YdcE_5679,5679.4,5.319,taxes and will not and if I'm reelected
qqG96G8YdcE_5681,5681.88,4.92,that'll be the case again but this guy
qqG96G8YdcE_5684,5684.719,4.761,is has increased your taxes because of
qqG96G8YdcE_5686,5686.8,5.12,the deficit number one he's increased
qqG96G8YdcE_5689,5689.48,4.92,inflation because of the debacle he left
qqG96G8YdcE_5691,5691.92,4.6,after the way he handled the pandemic
qqG96G8YdcE_5694,5694.4,4.4,and he finds himself in a position where
qqG96G8YdcE_5696,5696.52,3.92,he now wants to tax you more by putting
qqG96G8YdcE_5698,5698.8,3.919,a 10% tariff on everything that comes
qqG96G8YdcE_5700,5700.44,4.56,into the United States of America what I
qqG96G8YdcE_5702,5702.719,4.96,did when for example he wants to get
qqG96G8YdcE_5705,5705.0,8.28,away with get rid of the ability of

qqG96G8YdcE_5739,5739.92,3.199,doesn't have to pay the exorbitant
qqG96G8YdcE_5741,5741.199,5.48,prices I'm going to make that available
