153.01,
161.28,Trump gentlemen thanks so much for being
163.64,here let's begin the debate and let's
165.2,start with the issue that voters
166.68,consistently say is their top concern
169.92,the economy President Biden inflation
172.76,has slowed but prices remain high since
175.959,you took office the price of Essentials
177.92,has increased for example basket of
180.4,groceries that cost $100 then now costs
183.64,more than
184.64,$120 and typical home prices have jumped
187.44,more than 30% what do you say to voters
190.08,who feel they are worse off under your
192.319,presidency than they were under
193.84,President Trump we got to take a look at
195.799,what I was left when I became president
198.04,what Mr Trump left me we had an economy
200.72,that was in freefall the pandemic was so
203.12,badly handled many people were dying all
205.72,he said was it's not that serious just
207.72,inject a little bleach into your arm
209.4,you'll be all right the economy
211.2,collapsed there were no jobs
213.439,unemployment rate Rose to 15% it was
216.28,terrible and so what we had to do is try
218.36,to put things back together again that's
220.48,exactly what we began to do we created
222.799,"15,000 new jobs we brought out position"
226.48,"where we have 800,000 new manufacturing"
228.879,jobs but there's more to be done there's
231.12,more to be done workingclass people are
232.84,still in trouble I come from Scranton
234.959,Pennsylvania I come of household where
237.04,the kitchen table if the things weren't
238.799,able to be met during the mon was a a
240.56,problem price of eggs the price of gas
242.68,the price of housing the price of a
244.319,whole range of things that's why I'm
245.879,working so hard to make sure I deal with
248.239,those problems and we're going to make
249.879,sure that we reduce the price of housing
252.239,we're going to make sure we build two
254.04,two million new units we're going to
255.64,make sure we cap rents so corporate
257.6,greed can't take over the combination
259.639,but of was left with in corporate greed
261.04,is the reason why we're in this problem
262.479,right now in addition to that we're in a
264.96,situation where if you had take a look
267.199,at all that was done in his
268.52,administration he he didn't do much at
270.84,all by the time he left there things
272.8,were in chaos literally chaos and so we
276.28,put things back together we created I
277.8,said those jobs we make sure we had a
279.72,situation where we now we brought down
282.52,the price of prescription drugs which is
284.12,a major issue for many people to $15 for
287.68,for uh a insulin shot as opposed to $400
291.68,no senior has to pay more than $200 for
294.52,any drug all the drugs they can include
296.8,beginning next year in a situation as
299.8,make and we're going to make that
300.68,available to everybody to all Americans
302.96,so we're working to bring down the price
304.44,of around the kitchen table and that's
306.28,what we're going to get done thank you
308.479,president Trump we had the greatest
310.68,economy in the history of our country we
313.759,have never done so well every everybody
317.0,was amazed by it other countries were
318.84,copying us we got hit with covid and
322.24,when we did we spent the money necessary
324.72,so we wouldn't end up in a Great
326.319,Depression the likes of which we had in
328.44,1929 but by the time we finished so we
330.84,did a great job we got a lot of credit
332.28,for the economy a lot of credit for the
333.88,military and no Wars and so many other
336.759,things everything was rocking good but
339.039,the thing we never got the credit for
340.639,and we should have is getting us out of
342.44,that covid mess uh he created mandates
345.4,that was a disaster for our country but
347.639,other than that we had we had given them
349.84,back a a country where the stock market
353.039,actually was higher than preco and
355.199,nobody thought that was even possible uh
357.52,the only jobs he created are for illegal
359.96,immigrants and bounceback jobs a
361.72,bounceback from the co he has not done a
364.24,good job he's done a poor job in
365.72,inflation's killing our country it is
367.68,absolutely killing us thank you
370.0,President Biden well look the greatest
372.16,economy in the world he's the only one
373.8,that thinks that I think I don't know
375.0,anybody else that thinks he's he the
376.56,greatest economy in the world and you
378.84,know the fact of the matter is that uh
381.44,we PR ourselves in a situation where his
384.84,his economy he rewarded the wealthy he
387.56,had the largest tax cut in American
389.12,history $2 trillion he raised a deficit
391.84,larger than any president has in any one
393.68,term he's the only President other than
395.88,Herbert Hoover who's had lost more jobs
398.08,than he had when he began since Herbert
399.96,Hoover the idea that he did something
402.16,that was significant in the military you
404.88,know when he was president there were
406.759,still killing people in Afghanistan he
409.0,didn't do anything about that when he
410.68,was President we were still find
411.88,ourselves in a position where you had a
414.56,notion that we were this safe country
417.8,the truth is I'm the only president
420.16,this Century that doesn't have any this
423.039,this decade that don't any troops dying
425.72,anywhere in the world like he did uh
428.8,president Trump I want to follow up if I
431.0,can you want I allowed to respond to him
433.039,well I'm going to ask you a follow up
434.0,you can do whatever you want with the
435.0,minute that we give you um I I want to
436.759,follow up you you want to impose a 10%
438.919,tariff on all Goods coming into the US
441.599,how will you ensure that that doesn't
443.199,drive prices even higher not going to
444.879,drive them higher it's just going to
446.039,cause countries that have been ripping
447.44,us off for years like China and many
449.8,others in all fairness to China it's
451.759,going to just force them to pay us a lot
453.639,of money reduce our deficit tremendously
456.08,and give us a lot of power for other
457.72,things but he would he made a statement
459.759,the only thing he was right about is I
461.12,gave you the largest tax cut in history
463.72,I also gave you the largest regulation
465.52,cut in history that's why we had all the
467.199,jobs and the jobs went down and then
469.12,they bounced back and he's taking credit
470.759,for bounceback jobs you can't do that he
472.96,also said he inherited 9% inflation now
476.36,he inherited almost no inflation and it
478.44,stayed that way for 4 15 months and then
480.8,it blew up under his leadership because
482.759,they spent money like a bunch of people
485.0,that didn't know what they were doing
486.4,and they don't know what they were doing
487.479,it was the worst probably the worst
489.159,Administration in history there's never
491.199,been and as far as Afghanistan is
493.36,concerned I was getting out of
495.0,Afghanistan but we were getting out with
497.08,dignity with strength with power he got
500.319,out it was the most embarrassing day in
502.28,the history of our country's life
504.599,president Trump over the last eight
506.36,years under both of your administrations
508.52,the national debt soord to record highs
510.96,and according to a new nonpartisan
512.64,analysis president Trump your
513.919,Administration approved $8.4 trillion in
516.399,new debt while so far President Biden
518.44,you've approved $4.3 trillion in new
521.24,debt so former president Trump many of
523.12,the tax cuts that you signed into law
525.16,are set to expire next year you want to
527.76,extend them and go even further you say
530.12,with the US facing trillion dollar
532.2,deficits and record debt why should top
534.839,earners and corporations pay even less
537.12,in taxes than they do now because the
539.48,tax cuts spurred the greatest economy
541.64,that we've ever seen just prior to co
543.44,and even after Co it was so strong that
545.279,we were able to get through Co much
547.079,better than just about any other country
549.36,but we spurred that tax spurred now when
552.079,we cut the taxes as an example the uh
554.44,corporate tax was cut down to 21% from
557.16,39% plus beyond that uh we took in more
560.519,Revenue with much less tax and companies
563.279,were bringing back trillions of dollars
565.16,back into our country the country was
567.76,going like never before and we were
569.92,ready to start paying down debt we're
571.68,ready to start using the liquid gold
573.44,right under our feet the oil and gas
575.519,right under our feet we were going to
577.24,have something that nobody else has had
579.68,we got hit with covid we did a lot to
581.959,fix it I gave him an unbelievable
584.079,situation with all of the Therapeutics
586.72,and all of the things that we came up
588.56,with we we gave him something great
590.959,remember more people died under his
594.079,administration even though we had
595.92,largely fixed it more people died under
598.519,his administration
599.959,than our Administration and we were
601.56,right in the middle of it something
603.12,which a lot of people don't like to talk
604.72,about but he had far more people dying
607.12,in his administration he did the mandate
609.44,which is a disaster mandating it the
612.0,vaccine went out he did a mandate on the
613.88,vaccine which is the thing that people
616.0,most objected to about the vaccine and
618.519,he did a very poor job just a very poor
620.8,job and I will tell you not only poor
623.12,there but throughout the entire world
625.0,we're no longer respected as a country
627.2,they don't respect our leadership they
628.92,don't respect the United States anymore
631.12,we're like a third world Le between
633.44,weaponization of his election trying to
635.88,go after his political opponent all of
638.079,the things he's done we've become like a
639.839,third world nation and it's a shame the
642.88,damage he's done to our country and I'd
645.32,love to ask him and will why he allowed
647.48,millions of people to come in here from
649.36,prisons jails and mental institutions to
652.12,come into our country and destroy our
654.24,country president Trump we will get to
656.36,immigration uh later in this block
658.519,President Biden uh I want to give you an
660.079,opportunity to respond to this question
661.68,about the national debt he had the
663.88,largest national debt of any president
665.639,fouryear period number one number two
668.72,that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the
671.2,very wealthy I what I'm going to do is
673.56,fix the tax system for example we have a
676.04,thousand trillionaires in America I mean
678.32,billionaires in America and what's
680.12,happening they're in a situation where
682.519,they in fact pay 88.2% in taxes if they
685.56,just paid 24% or 25% either one of those
688.839,numbers they'd raised $500 million
692.04,billion dollars I should say in a
693.76,10-year period we'd be able to WR wipe
695.88,out his debt we'd be able to help make
697.76,sure that all those things we need to do
699.76,Child Care Elder Care making sure that
702.16,we continue to Str strengthen our health
704.32,care System making sure that we're able
706.12,to make every single solitary
709.2,person eligible for what I've been able
711.399,to do with the uh with with the covid
714.6,excuse me with um dealing with
717.48,everything we have to do with uh
721.639,look if we finally beat Medicare thank
726.16,you president uh Biden president Trump
728.839,well he's right he did beat Medicare he
730.48,beat it to death and he's destroying
732.16,Medicare because all of these people are
734.76,coming in they're putting them on
736.399,Medicare they're putting them on Social
738.6,Security they're going to destroy Social
740.399,Security this man is going to
742.0,single-handedly destroy Social Security
744.48,these millions and millions of people
746.199,coming in they're trying to put them on
748.079,Social Security he will wipe out Social
751.04,Security he will wipe out Medicare so he
753.68,was right in the way he finished that
755.199,sentence and it's a shame what's
757.0,happened to our country in the last four
759.519,years is not to be believed foreign
762.04,countries I'm friends with a lot of
763.839,people they cannot believe what happened
765.839,to the United States of America we're no
767.88,longer respected they they don't like us
771.0,we give them everything they want and
772.959,they they think we're stupid they think
774.76,we're very stupid people what we're
776.72,doing for other countries and they do
778.72,nothing for us what this man has done is
782.16,absolutely criminal thank you president
784.88,Trump danana this is the first
786.959,presidential election since the Supreme
789.44,Court overturned roie Wade this morning
792.68,the Court ruled on yet another abortion
795.079,case temporarily allowing emergency
797.76,abortions to continue in Idaho despite
800.72,that State's restrictive ban former
802.88,president Trump you take credit for the
805.399,decision to overturn roie Wade which
808.24,returned the issue of abortion to the
810.32,states correct however the federal
813.079,government still plays a role in whether
815.16,or not women have access to abortion
818.48,pills they're used in about 2third of
821.959,all abortions as president would you
825.16,block abortion medication first of all
827.839,the Supreme Court just approved the
829.88,abortion pill and I agree with their
832.399,decision to have done that and I will
834.16,not block it and if you look at this
837.0,whole question that you're asking a
839.36,complex but not really complex 51 years
842.0,ago you had Ro v Wade and everybody
844.92,wanted to get it back to the States
846.639,everybody without exception Democrats
848.519,Republicans liberals conservatives
851.0,everybody wanted it back religious
852.72,leaders and what I did is I put three
855.56,great Supreme Court Justices on the
857.519,court and they happened to vote in favor
860.0,of killing Ro v Wade and moving it back
862.92,to the States this is something that
864.92,everybody wanted now 10 years ago or so
867.72,they started talking about how many and
869.44,how many this getting into other things
871.519,but every legal scholar throughout the
874.079,world the most respected wanted it
876.639,brought back to the States I did that
878.759,now the states are working it out if you
880.72,look at Ohio it was a decision that was
882.839,it was an end result that was a little
884.68,bit more liberal than you would have
886.12,thought uh Kansas I would say the same
888.36,thing uh Texas is different Florida is
890.88,different but they're all making their
892.519,own decisions right now and right now
895.199,the states control it that's the vote of
897.279,the people like Ronald re rean I believe
899.88,in the exceptions I am a person that
902.36,believes and frankly I think it's
904.68,important to believe in the exceptions
906.079,some people you have to follow your
907.24,heart some people don't believe in that
909.24,but I believe in the exceptions for rape
911.92,incest and the life of the mother I
914.279,think it's very important some people
916.12,don't follow your heart but you have to
918.16,get elected also and because that has to
920.56,do with other things you got to get
922.04,elected the problem they have is they're
924.32,radical because they will take the life
926.639,of a child in the eighth month the ninth
928.72,month and even after birth after birth
930.8,if you look at the former governor of
932.44,Virginia he was willing to do this he
935.16,said we'll put the baby aside and we'll
937.48,determine what we do with the baby
938.959,meaning we'll kill the baby what
941.399,happened is we brought it back to the
943.079,states and the country is now coming
945.44,together on this issue it's been a great
947.519,thing thank you President Biden it's
949.8,been a terrible thing what you've done
952.079,the fact is that the vast majority of
953.959,constitutional Scholars support it row
955.6,when it was decided support it row and
959.079,was that's this idea that they're all
960.959,against it is just ridiculous and this
962.959,is the guy who says the state should be
964.44,able to have it we're in a state we're
966.44,in six weeks you don't even know whether
968.88,you're pregnant or not but you cannot
970.44,see a doctor have your and have him
972.839,decide on what your circumstances are
975.199,whether you need help the idea that
977.279,states are able to do this is a little
978.8,like saying we're going to turn civil
980.68,rights back to the States Let each state
982.639,have a different rule look there's so
984.6,many young women who have been including
986.519,a young woman who just was murdered and
989.44,he he went to the funeral uh the idea
992.399,that she was murdered by a by by an
995.279,immigrant coming into they talk about
997.72,that but here's the deal there's a lot
999.72,of young women are being raped by their
1002.079,by their in-laws by their by by their
1004.6,spouses brothers and sisters by just
1008.399,it's it's just ridiculous and they can
1010.04,do nothing about it and they try to
1011.68,arrest them when they cross state line
1013.199,thank you there have been many young
1015.959,women murdered by the same people he
1018.639,allowed to come across our border we
1021.079,have a border that's the most dangerous
1022.839,place anywhere in the world considered
1024.48,the most dangerous place anywhere in the
1026.24,world and he opened it up and these
1028.4,killers are coming into our country and
1030.6,they are raping and killing women and
1033.28,it's a terrible thing as far as the
1035.0,abortions concerned it is now back with
1036.72,the states the states are voting uh in
1039.16,many cases the it's frankly a very
1041.52,liberal decision in many cases it's the
1043.48,opposite but they're voting and it's
1045.439,bringing it back to the vote of the
1046.76,people which is what everybody wanted
1049.16,including the founders if they knew
1051.0,about this issue which frankly they
1052.88,didn't but they would have everybody
1055.36,wanted brought back Ronald Reagan wanted
1057.48,it brought back he wasn't able to get it
1059.72,everybody wanted it brought back and
1061.799,many presidents had tried to get it back
1064.6,I was the one to do it and again this
1066.48,gives it the vote of the people and
1068.64,that's where they wanted it every legal
1070.6,scholar Wanted It That Way staying on
1073.36,the topic of abortion President Biden
1075.4,seven states I'll let you do that this
1078.44,is a same topic seven states have no
1081.48,legal restrictions on how far into a
1084.039,pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion
1087.039,do you support any legal limits on how
1089.48,late a woman should be able to terminate
1091.28,a pregnancy I supported row v Wade which
1094.24,had three trimesters the first time is
1096.88,between the woman and the doctor second
1099.0,time is between the doctor and an
1101.08,extreme situation the third time is
1103.44,between the doctor I mean between the
1106.559,woman and the state the idea that the
1108.84,politicians the that the founders want
1111.159,the politicians to be the ones making
1113.28,decisions about Woman's Health is
1114.96,ridiculous that's the last no politician
1117.28,should be making that decision a doctor
1119.0,should be making those decisions that's
1120.72,how it should be run that's what you're
1122.48,going to do and if I'm elected I'm going
1124.24,to restore roie Wade so that means he
1127.28,can take the life of the baby in the
1129.72,ninth month and even after birth because
1132.36,some states Democrat run take it after
1135.0,birth again the governor former governor
1136.84,of Virginia put the baby down then we
1139.32,decide what to do with it so he's in
1141.44,he's willing to as we say rip the baby
1144.039,out of the womb in the ninth month and
1146.0,kill the baby nobody wants that to
1148.48,happen democrat or republican nobody
1150.6,wants it to happen ly that is simply not
1153.96,true the roie way does not provide for
1157.0,that that's not the circumstance only if
1159.2,woman's life is in danger she's going to
1160.76,die that's the only circumstance which
1162.6,that can happen but we are not for late
1164.88,term abortion period period period under
1168.24,roie W you have late term abortion you
1171.159,can do whatever you want depending on
1172.799,the state you can do whatever you want
1174.679,we don't think that's a good thing we
1176.2,think it's a radical thing we think the
1178.159,Democrats are the radicals not the
1179.96,Republicans for 51 years that was a law
1182.559,51 years constant of scholarship said it
1184.84,was the right way to go 51 years and it
1187.36,was taken away because this guy put very
1189.88,conservative members on the Supreme
1191.24,Court he takes credit for taking it away
1193.559,what's he going to do what's he going to
1195.159,do in fact if the if the Maga
1197.679,Republicans he gets elected and the Maga
1199.96,Republicans control the Congress and
1201.799,they pass an Universal van on abortion
1204.679,period across the board at six weeks or
1207.24,seven or eight or 10 weeks something
1209.08,very very conservative is he going to
1210.88,sign that bill I'll veto it he'll sign
1213.4,it thank you let's turn down to the
1215.64,issue of immigration and border security
1217.52,President Biden a record number of
1219.44,migrants have illegally crossed the
1221.28,southern border on your watch
1223.2,overwhelming border states and
1225.08,overburdening cities such as New York
1226.72,and Chicago and in some cases causing
1228.84,Safety and Security concerns given that
1231.44,why should voters trust you to solve
1233.48,this crisis because we worked very hard
1235.799,to get a bipartisan agreement that not
1237.76,only changed all of that made sure that
1240.72,we are in a situation where you had no
1243.679,circumstance where they could come
1245.08,across the border with the number of
1247.039,Border Police there are now we
1248.679,significantly increased the number of
1250.32,Asylum officers significantly by the way
1252.52,the border patrol endorsed me endorsed
1255.12,my position in addition to that we find
1257.44,ourselves in a situation where when he
1259.28,was president he was taking separating
1261.36,babies from their mothers putting them
1263.44,in cages making sure they were the
1265.919,families were separated that's not the
1268.039,right way to go what I've done since
1270.08,I've changed the law what's happened
1272.44,I've changed it in a way that now you're
1274.559,in a situation where they're 40% fewer
1277.64,people coming across the border legally
1279.6,that's better than when he left office
1281.6,and I'm going to continue to move until
1283.159,we get the total ban on the the the
1286.799,total initiative relative to what we can
1289.08,do with more border patrol and more
1292.12,Asylum officers president Trump I really
1294.799,don't know what he said at the end of
1296.08,that sentence I don't think he knows
1297.64,what he said either look we had the
1299.919,safest Border in the history of our
1301.32,country the B all he had to do is leave
1303.559,it all he had to do is leave it he
1305.6,decided to open up our border open up
1307.679,our country to people that are from
1311.2,prisons people that are from mental
1313.84,institutions insane asylum terrorists we
1316.44,have the largest number of terrorists
1317.96,coming into our country right now all
1319.76,terrorists all over the world not just
1321.679,in South America all over the world they
1323.559,come from the Middle East everywhere all
1325.559,over the world they're pouring in and
1327.72,this guy just left it open and he didn't
1330.159,need legislation because I didn't have
1332.12,legislation I said close the border we
1333.88,had the safest Border in history in that
1336.159,final couple of months of my presidency
1338.72,we had according to border patrol who is
1341.159,great and by the way who endorsed me for
1342.919,president but I won't say that but they
1344.88,endorse me for president Brandon just
1347.64,speak to him but look we had the safest
1350.4,Border in history now we have the worst
1352.2,Border in history there's never been
1353.72,anything like it and people are dying
1355.679,all over the place including the people
1357.4,that are coming up in president Trump
1359.679,President Biden the only terrorist who's
1362.12,done anything crossing the border is one
1364.32,who came along and killed three under
1366.159,his administration killed an Al-Qaeda
1368.76,person come in and his administration
1371.64,kill three American soldiers kill three
1374.72,American soldiers that's the only
1376.44,terrorist that there I'm not saying it
1378.52,no terrorist ever got through but the
1379.76,idea they're emptying their prisons
1381.559,we're we're welcoming these people
1383.24,that's simply not true there is no data
1385.36,to support what he said once again he's
1387.44,exaggerating he's lying president Trump
1390.6,um staying on the topic of immigration
1392.52,you've said that you're going to carry
1393.559,out quote the largest domestic
1395.159,deportation operation in American
1397.08,history unquote does that mean that you
1398.96,will Deport every undocumented immigrant
1401.4,in America including those who have jobs
1403.64,including those whose spouses are
1405.76,citizens and including those who have
1407.44,lived here for decades if so how will
1409.84,you do it just one second he said we
1412.08,killed three people the people we killed
1414.799,are Al baghdaddy and salaman the two
1418.4,greatest terrorists biggest terrorists
1419.88,anywhere in the world and it had a huge
1421.799,impact on everything not just border on
1424.4,everything he's the one to kill people
1426.559,with the bad water including hundreds of
1429.4,thousands of people dying and also
1431.919,killing our citizens when they come in
1434.48,we we are living right now in A Rat's
1436.919,Nest they're killing our people in New
1439.2,York in California in every state in the
1442.279,Union because we don't have borders
1443.76,anymore every state is now a border and
1446.4,because of his ridiculous insane and
1449.24,very stupid policies people are coming
1451.64,in and they're killing our citizens at a
1454.2,level that we've never SE we call it
1455.96,migrant crime I call it Biden migrant
1459.0,crime they're killing our citizens at a
1461.24,level that we've never seen before and
1463.2,you're reading it like these three
1465.08,incredible young girls over the last few
1467.159,days one of them I just spoke to the
1469.399,mother and they just had the funeral for
1472.24,this girl 12 years old this is horrible
1475.36,what's taking place what's taking place
1477.2,in our country we're literally an
1480.2,uncivilized country now he doesn't want
1482.6,it to be he just doesn't know he open
1484.72,the borders nobody's ever seen anything
1486.84,like and we have to get a lot of these
1488.679,people out and we have to get them out
1490.12,fast because they're going to destroy
1491.72,our country just take a look at where
1493.44,they're living they're living in luxury
1495.799,hotels in New York City and other places
1498.919,our veterans are on the street they're
1500.6,dying because he doesn't care about our
1502.159,veterans he doesn't care he doesn't like
1503.559,the military at all and he doesn't care
1505.88,about our veterans nobody been worse I
1508.0,had the highest approval rating for
1509.76,veterans taking care of the VA he has
1512.24,the worst he's gotten rid of all the
1513.799,things that I approved chice that I got
1515.76,through Congress all of the different
1517.88,things I approved they abandoned we had
1520.84,by far the highest and now it's down in
1522.84,less than half because he's done all
1525.0,these great things that we did and I
1526.96,think he did it just because I approved
1528.64,it which is crazy but he has killed so
1531.12,many people at our border by allowing
1533.2,all of these people to come in a very
1535.52,sad day Ander President Biden you have
1537.159,the mic every single thing he said Is A
1538.84,Lie every single one for example
1541.799,veterans are a hell of a lot better off
1543.32,since I P passed the pack attac one
1545.64,million of them now have insurance and
1547.72,their families have it their families
1549.72,have it because what happened whether it
1551.72,was agent orange or burn pits they're
1554.159,all being covered now and he oppos his
1557.0,group opposed that also in a situation
1559.279,where we have great respect for veterans
1561.2,my spent my son spent a year in Iraq
1563.48,living one next to one of those burn
1564.96,pits came back with Stage for G blastoma
1567.96,I was recently in in in France for a
1571.52,D-Day and I spoke to all about those
1574.279,Heroes that died I went to the World War
1576.52,II Cemetery World War I Cemetery he
1578.88,refused to go to he was standing with
1580.76,his fourstar General and he told me he
1582.96,said I don't want to go in there because
1584.2,they're a bunch of losers and suckers my
1586.36,son was not a loser was not a sucker
1588.44,you're the sucker you're the loser
1590.64,president Trump uh first of all that was
1592.96,a madeup quote suckers and losers they
1594.88,made it up it was in a third rate
1596.48,magazine that's failing like many of
1598.24,these magazines uh he made that up he
1600.799,put it in commercials we've notified him
1603.2,we had 19 people that said I didn't say
1605.32,it and think of this who would say I'm
1607.52,at a cemetery or I'm talking about our
1609.679,veterans because nobody's taken better
1611.76,care I'm so glad this came up and he
1613.76,brought it up there's nobody that's
1616.24,taken better care of our soldiers than I
1618.08,have
1618.88,to think that I would in front of
1620.84,generals and others say suckers and
1622.96,losers we have 19 people that said it
1626.08,was never said by me it was made up by
1628.679,him just like Russia Russia Russia was
1630.6,made up just like the 51 intelligence
1633.48,agents are made up just like the new
1635.919,thing with the 16 economists are talking
1638.36,it's the same thing 51 intelligence
1640.48,agents said that the laptop was Russia
1643.559,disinformation it wasn't that came from
1645.96,his son Hunter it wasn't Russia
1648.399,disinformation he made up the suckers
1650.72,and losers so he should apologize to me
1653.159,right now fourstar General standing at
1655.76,your side was on your staff who said you
1657.72,said it period that's number one and
1660.76,number two the idea the idea that I have
1663.48,to apologize to you for anything along
1665.799,the line we've done more for veterans
1667.72,than any president has in American
1669.159,history American history and they now
1671.679,are their family the only sacred
1673.519,obligation we have as a country is to
1675.44,care for our veterans when they come
1676.84,home and their families and equip them
1678.88,when they go to war that's what we're
1680.76,doing that's what the VA is doing now
1683.08,they're doing more for veterans than
1684.679,ever before in our history all right
1686.6,thank you so much let's move to the
1688.159,topic of foreign policy I want to begin
1690.32,with Russia's war against Ukraine which
1693.36,is now in its third year former
1695.88,president Trump Russian President
1698.2,Vladimir Putin says he'll only end this
1700.96,war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian
1703.519,territory it is already claimed and
1705.96,Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO
1710.08,are Putin's terms acceptable to you
1712.36,first of all our veterans and our
1715.0,soldiers can't stand this guy they can't
1718.0,stand him they think he's the worst
1719.88,commander-in-chief if that's what you
1721.32,call him that we've ever had they can't
1723.76,stand him so let's get that straight and
1726.24,they like me more than just about any of
1728.08,them and that's based on every single
1730.64,bit of information as far as Russia and
1733.519,Ukraine if we had a real president the
1736.08,president that knew that was respected
1738.2,by Putin he would have never he would
1740.36,have never invaded Ukraine a lot of
1743.0,people are dead right now much more than
1745.0,people know you know they talk about
1746.36,numbers you can double those numbers
1747.88,maybe triple those numbers he did
1750.24,nothing to stop it in fact I think he
1751.799,encouraged Russia from going in I tell
1754.12,you what happened he was so bad with
1755.64,Afghanistan it was such a horrible
1758.24,embarrassment most embarrassing moment
1760.2,in the history of our country that when
1762.2,Putin watched that and he saw the
1763.919,incompetence that he should he should
1765.519,have fired those generals like I fired
1767.399,the one that you mentioned and so he's
1769.24,got no love loss but he should have
1771.039,fired those generals no General got
1773.559,fired for the most embarrassing moment
1776.399,in the history of our country
1777.72,Afghanistan where we left billions of
1780.039,dollars of equipment behind we lost 13
1782.559,beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were
1785.279,obliterated and by the way we left
1787.0,people behind too we left American
1788.64,citizens behind when Putin saw that he
1791.12,said you know what I think we're going
1793.12,to go in and maybe take my this was his
1795.96,dream I talked to him about it his dream
1798.279,the difference is he never would have
1800.44,invaded Ukraine never just like Israel
1804.279,would have never been invaded in a
1807.24,million years by Hamas you know why
1810.399,because Iran was broke with me I
1812.48,wouldn't let anybody do business with
1814.159,them they ran out of money they were
1815.6,broke they had no money for Hamas they
1817.6,had no money for anything no money for
1819.64,Terror that's why you had no Terror at
1821.679,all during my Administration this place
1824.799,the whole world is blowing up under him
1828.24,President Biden I've never heard so much
1830.6,malar in my whole life look the fact of
1832.399,the matter is that we're in a situation
1834.039,where let's take the last Point first
1836.279,Iran attacked American troops kill
1839.88,caused brain damage for a number of
1842.2,these troops and he did nothing about it
1844.48,recent when he was president they they
1846.679,attacked he said they're just having
1848.519,headaches that's all it is he didn't do
1850.84,a thing when they attack took place
1852.76,number one number two we got over
1855.72,"100,000 Americans and others out of of"
1859.72,Afghanistan during that airlift number
1862.44,three we found ourselves in a situation
1864.72,where if you take a look at what Trump
1866.919,did in Ukraine he this guy told Ukraine
1870.44,told Trump do whatever you want and do
1873.24,whatever you want and that's exactly
1875.559,what Trump did to Putin encourage him do
1878.799,whatever you want and he went in listen
1880.72,to what he said when he went in it was
1882.399,going to take ke in five days remember
1884.6,because it's part of the old Soviet
1886.0,Union that's what he wanted to
1887.399,reestablish
1888.72,ke and he in fact didn't do it at all he
1891.32,didn't wasn't able to get it done and
1893.24,they've lost over they've lost thousands
1895.519,"of thousands of troops 500,000 troops"
1898.96,president Trump I come back to you for
1900.76,for one minute I just want to go back to
1902.48,my original question which is are
1904.6,Putin's terms acceptable to you keeping
1907.399,the territory in UK acceptable no
1909.159,they're not acceptable but look this is
1912.039,a war that never should have started if
1913.84,we had a leader in this war he led
1916.039,everybody along he's given $200 billion
1919.32,now or more to Ukraine he's given $200
1922.44,billion that's a lot of money I don't
1924.6,think there's ever been anything like it
1926.2,every time that zalinski comes to this
1928.6,country he walks away with $60 billion
1930.279,do he's the greatest salesman ever and
1932.44,I'm not knocking him I'm not knocking
1934.159,anything I'm only saying the money that
1937.159,we're spending on this war and we
1940.0,shouldn't be spending it should have
1941.639,never happened I will have that War
1944.519,settled between Putin and zalinski as
1947.44,president elect before I take office on
1949.679,January 20th I'll have that War settled
1952.12,people being killed so needlessly so
1955.44,stupidly and I will get it settled and
1957.919,I'll get it settled fast before I take
1960.24,office President Biden you have a minute
1963.519,the fact is that Putin is a war criminal
1966.2,he's killed thousands and thousands of
1968.679,people and he has made one thing clear
1971.799,he wants to reestablish what was part of
1974.24,the Soviet Empire not just a pieace he
1976.48,wants all of Ukraine that's what he
1978.44,wants and then you think he'll stop
1980.159,there do you think he'll stop when he if
1982.919,he if he takes Ukraine what do you think
1984.84,happens to Poland what do you think
1986.519,bellarus what do you think happens to
1987.96,those NATO countries and so if you want
1989.96,a war you ought to find out what he's
1992.24,going to do because if in fact he does
1994.559,what he says and walks away by the way
1997.519,all that money we give Ukraine from
1999.72,weapons we make here in the United
2001.08,States we give them the weapons not the
2003.0,money at this point and and our NATO
2005.32,allies have produced as much funding for
2008.559,Ukraine as we have that's why it's
2011.039,that's why we're strong thank you moving
2013.48,on to the Middle East in October Hamas
2016.72,attacked Israel killing more than a
2019.039,thousand people and taking hundreds of
2021.08,hostages among those held and thought to
2023.76,still be alive our five Americans
2026.559,Israel's response has killed thousands
2028.399,of Palestinians and created a
2030.08,humanitarian crisis in Gaza President
2033.0,Biden you've put forward a a proposal to
2036.44,resolve this conflict
2038.32,but so far Hamas has not released the
2041.44,remaining hostages and Israel is
2043.32,continuing its military offensive in
2045.279,Gaza so what additional leverage will
2048.32,you use to get Hamas and Israel to end
2051.639,the war you have two minutes number one
2054.76,everyone from the United Nations secur
2058.0,security Council straight through to the
2060.04,G7 to the Israelis and Neto himself have
2062.72,endorsed the plan I put forward endorsed
2065.04,the plan I put forward which has three
2066.96,stages to it the first stage is trade
2070.079,the hostages for a ceasefire second
2073.76,phase is a ceasefire with additional
2075.679,conditions the third phase is no the end
2078.56,of the war the only one who wants the
2080.44,war to continue is Hamas number one
2082.8,they're the only ones standing out we're
2084.48,still pushing hard from to get them to
2087.28,accept in the meantime what's happened
2089.879,in Israel we're find the only thing I've
2092.079,"denied Israel was 2,000lb bombs they"
2095.52,don't work very well in populated areas
2097.4,they whole lot innocent people we're
2099.32,providing Israel with all the weapons
2100.8,they need and when they need them and by
2102.68,the way I'm the guy that organized the
2105.24,world against Iran when they had a
2107.359,full-blown intercontinental bistic
2109.72,ballistic missile attack on Israel no
2112.32,one was hurt no one Israeli was
2115.16,accidentally killed and it stopped we
2118.56,saved Israel we are the biggest producer
2121.839,of support for Israel of anyone in the
2123.64,world and so that's they're two
2125.72,different things Hamas can not be
2128.4,allowed to be continue we continue to
2130.24,send our experts and our intelligent
2132.119,people as to how they can get Hamas like
2134.359,we did Ben Laden you don't have to do it
2137.0,and by the way they've been greatly
2138.839,weakened toas greatly weakened and they
2140.92,should be they should be eliminated but
2143.359,you've got to be careful for what using
2145.44,certain weapons among population
2149.68,centers just going back to Ukraine for
2151.92,one second we have an ocean separating
2154.92,us the European nations together
2158.4,have spent a hundred billion or maybe
2160.839,more than that less than us why doesn't
2163.88,he call them and say you got to put up
2165.28,your money like I did with NATO I got
2167.079,them to put up hundreds of billions of
2168.96,dollars the Secretary General of NATO
2171.119,said Trump did the most incredible job
2172.8,I've ever seen you wouldn't they
2174.319,wouldn't have any they were going out of
2175.64,business we were spending almost 100% of
2177.92,the money was was paid by us he didn't
2181.2,do that he's getting all you got to ask
2183.88,these people to put up the money we're
2185.599,over a hundred billion dollar more spent
2187.76,and it has a bigger impact on them
2190.0,because of location because we have an
2191.839,ocean in between you got to ask them as
2194.04,far as Israel and and Hamas Israel is
2198.48,the one that wants to go he said the
2199.76,only one who wants to keep going is
2201.16,Hamas actually Israel is the one and you
2203.56,should let him go and let him finish a
2205.28,job he doesn't want to do it he's become
2207.04,like a Palestinian but they don't like
2209.24,him because he's a very bad Palestinian
2211.119,he's a weak
2212.2,one President Biden you have a minute
2214.72,I've never heard so much foolishness
2216.56,this is a guy who wants to get out of
2218.119,NATO are you going to stay in NATO he's
2220.079,going to pull out of NATO the idea that
2222.44,we have our strength lies in our
2224.56,alliances as well it may be a big ocean
2227.2,but we ever able to avoid a war in in
2229.4,Europe a major war in Europe what
2231.48,happens if in fact you have Putin
2233.64,continue to go into into NATO we have an
2236.0,article five agreement attack on one is
2238.119,Attack on all you want to start the
2239.96,nuclear war he keeps talking about go
2241.68,ahead let Putin go in and control
2244.319,Ukraine and then move on to Poland and
2246.88,other places
2248.319,see what happens then he has no idea
2250.359,what the hell he's talking about and by
2252.04,the way I got 50 other nations around
2254.04,the world to support Ukraine including
2256.56,Japan and South Korea because they
2259.2,understand that this this this kind of
2261.119,dislocation has a serious threat to the
2263.56,whole world peace no no major war in
2266.319,Europe has ever been able to be
2267.48,contained just to Europe president Trump
2270.4,just to follow up would you support the
2272.8,creation of an independent Palestinian
2274.839,state in order to achieve peace in the
2276.56,region I'd have to to see but before we
2278.48,do that the problem we have is that we
2281.24,spend all the money so they kill us on
2283.48,trade I made great trade deals with the
2285.68,European nations because if you add them
2288.28,up they're about the same size
2289.92,economically their economy is about the
2292.04,same size as the United States and they
2294.28,were no cars no they don't want anything
2296.88,that we have but we're supposed to take
2298.44,their cars their food their everything
2300.359,their agriculture I changed that but the
2303.599,big thing I changed is they don't want
2304.88,to pay and the only reason that he can
2307.839,play games with NATO is because I got
2310.72,them to put up hundreds of billions of
2312.48,dollars I said and he's right about this
2315.0,I said no I'm not going to support NATO
2317.359,if you don't pay they asked me that
2319.359,question would you guard us against
2321.0,Russia at a very secret meeting of the
2323.72,28 uh States at that time Nations at
2326.92,that time and they said no if you don't
2328.72,pay I won't do that and you know what
2330.68,happened billions and billions of
2333.0,dollars came flowing in the next day and
2334.96,the next months but now we're we're in
2337.64,the same position we're paying
2339.079,everybody's bills let's turn to the
2341.119,issue of democracy former president
2343.24,Trump I want to ask you about January 6
2345.8,2021 after you rallied your supporters
2348.359,that day some of them stormed the
2350.24,capital to stop the constitutionally
2352.24,mandated counting of electoral votes as
2355.04,president you swore an oath to quote
2356.92,preserve protect and defend unquote the
2359.44,Constitution what do you say to voters
2361.44,who believe that you violated that oath
2363.48,through your actions and in action on
2365.28,January 6 and worry that you'll do it
2367.0,again I don't think too many believe
2368.64,that and let me tell you about January
2370.2,6th on January 6th we had a great border
2374.4,nobody coming through very few on
2376.76,January 6th we were energy independent
2378.72,on January 6th we had the lowest taxes
2380.8,ever we had the lowest regulations ever
2383.52,on January 6 we were respected all over
2385.92,the world all over the world we were
2388.079,respected and then he comes in and we're
2390.72,now left that we're like a bunch of
2392.72,stupid people that what happened to the
2395.359,United States's reputation under this
2397.8,man's leadership is horrible including
2401.28,weaponization which I'm sure at some
2402.92,point you'll be talking about where he
2404.76,goes after his political opponent
2406.24,because he can't beat him fair and
2407.64,square you have 80 seconds left my
2410.359,question was what do you say to those
2412.359,voters who believe that you VI violated
2414.48,your constitutional oath through your
2416.16,actions in action on January 6 2021 and
2419.119,worry that you'll do it again well I
2420.68,didn't say that to anybody I said
2423.079,peacefully and patriotically and Nancy
2425.599,Pelosi if you just watched the news from
2427.92,two days ago on tape to her daughter
2430.359,who's a documentary filmmaker they say
2433.839,but she's saying oh no it's my
2436.04,responsibility I was responsible for
2438.119,"this because I offered her 10,000"
2440.079,soldiers or National Guard and she
2442.359,turned them down and the mayor of in
2444.599,writing by the way the mayor in writing
2446.8,turned it down the mayor of of DC they
2449.76,"turned it down I offered 10,000 because"
2452.4,I could see I had virtually nothing to
2455.2,do they asked me to go make a speech I
2457.4,could see what was happening everybody
2458.64,was saying they're going to be there on
2459.92,January 6 they're going to be there and
2461.68,I saidou know what there's a lot of
2463.119,people coming you could feel it you
2464.72,could feel it too and you could feel it
2466.92,and I said they ought to have some
2468.96,National Guard or whatever and I offered
2471.52,it to her and she now admits that she
2473.88,turned it down and it was the same day
2476.64,she was I don't know she can't be very
2478.64,happy with her daughter because it made
2479.92,her into a liar she said I take full
2482.44,responsibility for January 6th President
2486.079,Biden
2487.68,look he encouraged those folks who go up
2490.16,in Capitol Hill number one I sat in the
2492.92,dining room off the Oval Office he sat
2494.76,there for three hours three hours
2497.119,watching begging being begged by his
2500.04,vice president and a number of his
2501.72,colleagues on the Republican side as
2503.119,well to do something to call for a stop
2505.8,to end it instead he talked talked about
2508.2,these people being Patriots and and and
2510.56,great patrons of America in fact he says
2513.839,he'll now forgive them for what they've
2515.4,done he they've been con convicted he
2517.88,says he wants to commute their sentences
2520.319,and say that no but he went to every
2523.599,single Court in the nation I don't know
2525.52,how many cases scores of cases including
2528.52,the Supreme Court and they said they
2530.839,said no no this guy this guy is
2533.4,responsible for doing what is being was
2535.96,done he did do a damn thing and these
2538.56,people should be in jail and they should
2541.0,be ones are being held accountable and
2543.559,he wants to let them all out and now he
2545.52,says if he loses again such a Wier that
2547.64,he is that it could be a blood bath
2549.92,thank you President Biden president
2551.76,Trump what they've done to some people
2554.4,that are so innocent you ought to be
2556.52,ashamed of yourself what you have done
2558.28,how you've destroyed the lives of so
2560.079,many people when they RI down Portland
2563.24,when they rip down uh many other cities
2566.8,you go to Minnesota Minneapolis what
2569.24,they've done there with the fires all
2571.4,over the city if I didn't bring in the
2572.8,National Guard that City would have been
2574.559,destroyed when you look at all of the
2577.76,they took over big chunks of Seattle I
2579.839,was all set to bring in the National
2581.4,Guard they heard that they saw them
2582.88,coming and they left immediately what he
2585.92,said about this whole subject is so off
2589.64,peacefully patriotic one other
2591.76,thing the unselect committee which is
2595.4,basically two horrible Republicans that
2597.68,are all gone now out of office and
2600.44,Democrats all Democrats they destroyed
2603.64,and deleted all of the information they
2605.68,found because they found out we were
2606.96,right right we were right and they
2609.16,deleted and destroyed all of the
2610.88,information they should go to jail for
2612.8,that if a republican did that they'd go
2614.599,to jail thank you president Trump
2615.72,President Biden I want to give you a
2616.8,minute the only person on this stage is
2618.8,a convicted fellon and is the man I'm
2620.4,looking at right now and the fact of the
2622.68,matter is he isn't he's what he's
2625.0,telling you is simply not true the fact
2627.359,is that there was no effort on his part
2630.4,to stop what was going on up in Capitol
2632.8,Hill and all those people every one of
2634.68,those who were convicted deserves to be
2636.68,convicted it the idea that they didn't
2638.96,kill somebody just went in and broke
2640.72,down doors broke the windows occupied
2643.92,offices turned over desk turn them over
2647.0,statues the idea that those people are
2650.2,patriots come on when I asked him the
2653.16,first two debates we had the debates we
2655.24,had first time around I said will you
2657.88,denounce the proud boy he said no I'll
2660.2,tell them to stand by the idea he's
2662.76,refusing to will you denounce these guys
2665.88,you denounce the people we're talking
2667.119,talking about now you denounce the
2668.88,people who attack that Capital what are
2671.4,you going to
2672.76,do I'm going to uh give you a a minute
2676.079,president Trump for a follow-up question
2677.96,I have um after a jury convicted you of
2681.319,34 felonies last month you said if
2683.359,reelected you would quote have every
2685.48,right to go after unquote your political
2687.68,opponents you just talked about members
2689.68,of the select committee on January 6
2691.44,going to jail your main political
2693.359,opponent is standing on stage with you
2695.04,tonight can you clarify exactly what it
2697.079,means about you feeling you have every
2698.68,right to go after your political
2699.92,opponents well I said my retribution is
2702.599,going to be success we're going to make
2704.16,this country successful again because
2705.839,right now it's a failing Nation my
2707.76,retribution is going to be success but
2710.079,when he talks about a convicted felon
2711.8,his son is a convicted Fon at a very
2714.319,high level his son is convicted going to
2716.119,be convicted probably numerous other
2717.96,times should have been convicted before
2719.92,but his Justice apartment let the
2722.16,statute of limitations lapse on the most
2724.16,important things but he could be a
2726.0,convicted felon soon as he gets out of
2727.76,office Joe could be a convicted fellon
2729.48,with all of the things that he's done
2731.48,he's done horrible things all of the
2733.4,death caused at the the Border uh
2735.8,telling the Ukrainian people that we're
2738.359,going to want a billion dollars or you
2739.68,change the prosecutor otherwise you're
2741.72,not getting a billion dollars if I ever
2743.44,said that that's quid proquo that we're
2747.0,not going to do anything we're not going
2748.64,to give you a billion dollars unless you
2750.0,change your prosecutor having to do with
2751.68,his son this man is a criminal this man
2754.72,you're lucky you're lucky I did nothing
2757.16,wrong we'd have a system that was rigged
2759.559,and disgusting I did nothing wrong thank
2761.68,you president Trump President Biden you
2763.4,have said I'm coming right to you sir
2765.48,you well you want to respond go ahead
2767.16,I'll give you a minute to respond the
2769.28,idea that I did anything wrong relative
2772.2,to what you're talking about is
2773.319,outrageous it's simply a lie number one
2776.4,number two the idea that you have a
2778.599,right to seek retribution against any
2780.48,American just because your president is
2783.0,wrong is simply wrong no president's
2785.04,ever spoken like that before no present
2787.28,in our history has spoken like that
2788.64,before number three the crimes that you
2791.64,are still charged with and think of all
2793.319,the Civil penalties you have how many
2795.16,billions of dollars do you owe in civil
2796.72,penalties for for molesting a woman in
2799.44,public for doing a whole range of things
2802.28,of having sex with a porn star on the
2805.04,night while your wife was pregnant I
2807.559,mean what what are you talking about you
2810.68,you have the morals of an
2812.28,alleycat give you a minute sir I didn't
2814.48,have sex with a porn star number one
2817.0,number two that was a case that was
2818.68,started and moved they moved a
2821.4,high-ranking official a doj into the
2823.599,Manhattan DA's office to start that case
2826.48,that case is going to be appealed in one
2828.76,we had a very terrible judge a horrible
2831.92,judge Democrat the prosecutor were all
2835.0,high ranking Democrats appointed people
2837.76,and the both the civil and the criminal
2841.0,he basically went after his political
2843.28,opponent because he thought it was going
2844.88,to damage me but when the public found
2846.72,out out about these cases because they
2848.48,understand them better than he does he
2849.559,has no idea what these cases are but
2851.48,when he when they found out about these
2853.2,cases you know what they did my poll
2854.92,numbers went up way up you know that
2856.52,because you're reporting it and we took
2858.24,in more money in the last two weeks than
2860.48,we've ever taken in in the history of of
2862.96,any campaign I don't think any campaign
2865.119,has ever taken hundreds of millions of
2867.68,dollars came pouring in because the
2869.64,public knows it's a scam and it's a guy
2872.16,that's after his political opponent
2873.72,because he can't win fair and square
2875.72,thank you president Trump president
2877.04,Biden you have said quote Donald Trump
2879.2,and his magga Republicans are determined
2881.599,to destroy American democracy do you
2884.319,believe that the tens of millions of
2886.04,Americans who are likely to vote for
2888.04,president Trump will be voting against
2890.559,American democracy the more they know
2893.079,about what he's done yes the more they
2895.559,know about what he's done and there's a
2897.559,lot more coming he's got a lot of cases
2899.28,around the road coming around he's got
2901.44,he's got a whole range of issues he has
2903.72,to face I don't know what the juries
2905.44,will do but I knew and I do know he has
2907.559,a real problem and so the fact that
2910.319,could you ever think you hear any
2911.64,president say that I'm going to seek
2913.559,retribution you ever hear any president
2915.76,say that I thought Hitler had some good
2917.76,ideas what got me involved to run the
2919.839,first place after my son had died I
2921.44,decided in Iraq because of Iraq I said I
2924.4,wasn't going to run again until I saw
2926.44,what happened in Charlottesville
2927.559,Virginia people coming out of the woods
2929.64,carrying swastikas on torches torches
2932.92,and and singing the same anti-semitic B
2935.4,they sang when
2937.319,back in Germany and what did and the
2939.48,young woman got killed they spoke to the
2941.04,mother and she they asked him they said
2944.04,what what do you think of those people
2945.92,the people who the ones who got killed
2947.52,the one who tried to stop it and the on
2949.319,he said I think they're fine people on
2951.16,both sides what American president would
2954.76,ever say Nazis coming out of fields
2957.319,carrying torches singing the same
2959.799,anti-semitic B carrying swastikas were
2963.119,fine people this is the guy who says
2965.359,Hitler's done some good things I like to
2967.44,know what they are the good things
2969.079,Hitler's done that's what he said this
2971.0,guy has no sense of American
2973.2,democracy president Trump Jake both of
2975.96,you know that story has been totally
2978.119,wiped out because when you see the
2980.0,sentence it said 100% exoneration on
2983.599,that so he just keeps it going he says
2985.04,he ran because of Charlottesville he
2986.839,didn't run because of Charlottesville he
2988.559,ran because it was his last chance it
2991.28,he's not equipped to be president you
2992.96,know it and I know it it's ridiculous we
2994.599,have a debate we're trying to justify
2996.839,his presidency his presidency he's
2999.839,without question the worst president the
3002.68,worst presidency in the history of our
3004.52,country we shouldn't be having a debate
3006.64,about it there's nothing to debate he
3008.559,made up the Charlottesville story and
3010.52,you'll see it's debunked all over the
3012.44,place every anchor has de every
3014.64,reasonable anchor has debunked it and
3017.48,just the other day it came out where it
3019.04,was fully debunked it's a nonsense story
3022.72,he knows that and he didn't run because
3024.559,of Charlottesville he used that as an
3026.079,excuse to run
3027.96,president bid and debunk it happened all
3030.839,you have to do is listen to what was
3032.119,said at the time and the idea that
3034.92,somehow that's the only reason I ran I
3036.92,ran because I was worried a guy like
3038.4,this guy could get elected if he thought
3040.599,they were good people coming out of that
3042.319,all that Forest carrying those those
3044.599,woods carrying those torches that he
3046.599,didn't deserve to be president didn't
3048.359,deserve to be president at all and the
3050.24,idea that he's talking about all this
3052.88,being fabricated we saw with our own
3054.92,eyes we saw what happened on January 6th
3056.88,we saw the people breaking through the
3058.319,windows we saw people occupying that his
3061.0,own vice president look there's a reason
3063.04,why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers
3067.04,refused to endorse him this time his
3069.04,vice president hasn't endorsed him this
3070.559,time so why why they know him well they
3073.68,serve with him why are they not
3075.119,endorsing him thank you President Biden
3077.4,we're going to be right back with more
3078.68,from the CNN presidential
3085.559,debate
3115.52,e
3145.52,e
3175.44,e
3205.44,e
3235.44,e
3265.359,e e
3306.44,welcome back to the CNN presidential
3308.559,debate live from Georgia let's talk
3311.48,about persistent challenges you both
3313.68,faced in your first terms and you'd
3315.96,certainly face again in a second term
3318.599,President Biden while black unemployment
3321.319,dropped to a record low under your
3323.359,presidency black families still earn far
3326.039,less less than white families black
3328.76,mothers are still three times more
3330.76,likely to die from pregnancy related
3333.079,causes and black Americans are
3335.28,imprisoned at five times the rate of
3338.039,white Americans what do you say to Black
3340.48,voters who are disappointed that you
3342.52,haven't made more progress they
3344.559,acknowledge they made a lot of progress
3346.039,number one the fact of the matter is
3347.799,there's more small black businesses that
3349.96,have been started in any time in history
3352.319,number two the wages of black their
3354.92,black unemployment is the lowest level
3356.599,has been in a long long time number
3358.92,three we find find providing housing for
3361.92,black Americans and dealing with the
3364.88,segregation that exists among these
3368.16,corporate these corporate rations that
3370.48,collude to keep people out of their
3372.799,houses and in addition to that we find
3375.68,that the impact of on the the choice
3382.559,that black families have to make
3384.079,relative to child care is a incredibly
3387.359,difficult when we did the first major
3389.16,piece of legislation in the past I was
3391.16,able to reduce black child care costs I
3394.96,cut them in half in half we got to make
3397.68,sure we provide for child care cost we
3399.96,got to make sure because when you
3401.44,provide that child care protections you
3403.799,in increase economic growth because more
3406.16,people can be in the in the job market
3408.64,so there's more to be done considerably
3410.96,more to be done but we've done a great
3413.16,deal so far and I'm not letting up and
3414.92,they know it you have 49 seconds left
3418.68,what do you say to Black voters who are
3421.2,disappointed with the progress so far I
3423.4,say I don't blame them for being
3424.599,disappointed inflation is still hurting
3426.68,them badly for example I provided for
3429.119,the idea that any black family firsttime
3432.76,"home buyer should get a $10,000 tax"
3434.76,credit to be able to buy their first
3436.64,home so they can get started I made sure
3439.52,that we're in a situation where all
3441.319,those black families and those black
3442.799,individuals who provided had to take out
3445.319,student loans that were ballooning that
3448.319,if they were engaged in nursing doctor
3451.319,and any anything having to do with
3453.799,volunteerism if they paid their bills
3455.88,for 10 years on their student debt all
3458.72,the rest is Forgiven after 10 years
3460.799,Millions have benefited from that and
3462.88,we're going to do a whole lot more for
3465.0,black families thank you president Trump
3467.799,and he caused the inflation he's blaming
3470.119,inflation and he's right it's been very
3472.319,bad he caused the inflation and it's
3474.76,killing black families and Hispanic
3476.799,families and just about everybody it's
3479.079,killing people they can't buy groceries
3481.44,anymore they can't you look at the cost
3483.44,of food where it's doubled and tripled
3485.64,and quadrupled they can't live they're
3488.16,not living anymore he caused this
3490.68,inflation I gave him a country with no
3493.92,essentially no inflation it was perfect
3496.2,it was so good all he had to do is leave
3497.76,it alone he destroyed it with his green
3500.48,new scam and all of the other all this
3502.68,money that's being thrown out the window
3504.76,he caused inflation as sure as you're
3507.039,sitting there the fact is that his big
3510.92,kill on the black people is the millions
3513.88,of people that he's allowed to come in
3515.48,through the Border they're taking black
3517.039,jobs now and it could be 18 it could be
3520.16,19 and even 20 million people they're
3522.599,taking black jobs and they're taking
3524.599,Hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it
3526.599,yet but you're going to see something
3528.2,that's going to be the worst in our
3529.76,history thank you President Biden there
3532.599,was no inflation when I became president
3535.24,you know why the economy was flat on its
3537.68,back 15% unemployment he decimated the
3541.24,economy absolutely decimated the economy
3543.76,that's why there was no inflation at the
3545.799,time there were no jobs we provided
3548.44,thousands of millions of jobs for
3550.039,individuals who were in all communities
3551.96,including minority communities we made
3553.96,sure that they have health insurance we
3556.0,have covered if the ACA has incre I made
3559.119,"sure that they're $8,000 per person and"
3562.2,a family to get written off for
3564.28,healthare but this guy wants to Li that
3566.52,they tried 50 times he wants to get rid
3568.64,of the ACA again and they're going to
3570.64,try again if they win you find ourselves
3572.76,in a position where the idea that we're
3575.799,not doing any I put more we put more
3578.4,police on the street than any
3580.24,Administration has he wants to cut the
3582.48,cops we're providing for Equity equity
3585.4,and making sure people have a shot to
3587.92,make it there's a lot going on but in
3590.4,inflation he caused it by his tremendous
3594.4,amount feas into the the way handle the
3597.079,pandemic thank you another persistent
3599.2,challenge is the climate crisis 2023 was
3602.599,the hottest year in recorded history and
3605.079,communities across the country are
3607.2,confronting the devastating effects of
3609.24,extreme heat intensifying wildfires
3612.359,stronger hurricanes and rising sea
3614.16,levels former president Trump you've
3616.599,vowed to end your opponent's climate
3619.039,initiatives but will you take any action
3622.0,as president to slow the climate crisis
3624.48,well let me just go back to what he said
3626.28,about the police how close the police
3629.319,are to him almost every police group in
3631.92,the nation from every state is
3634.4,supporting Donald J Trump almost every
3637.359,police group and what he's done to the
3639.64,black population is horrible including
3642.4,the fact that for 10 years he called
3643.799,them super Predators we can't in the
3645.4,1990s we can't forget that super
3647.599,Predators was his name and he called it
3649.68,to him for 10 and they've taken great
3651.2,offense at it and now they see it
3652.68,happening but when they see what I did
3654.68,for criminal justice form and for the
3657.2,historically black uh colleges and
3659.72,universities where I funded them and got
3661.88,them all funded and the opportunity
3664.359,zones with with Tim as you know Tim
3666.72,Scott was incredible he did a great job
3669.24,great senator from South Carolina he
3671.559,came to me with the idea and it was a
3673.079,great idea it's one of the most
3674.28,successful Economic Development acts
3676.64,ever in the country opportunity zones
3679.2,and the biggest beneficiary are blacks
3681.44,and that's why we have the best numbers
3684.24,with them in maybe ever they're saying
3687.0,ever I read this morning whereever the
3688.88,best numbers he's lost much of the black
3692.599,population because he's done a horrible
3694.92,job for black people he's also done a
3697.119,horrible job for Hispanics but way do
3699.799,you see these millions of people pouring
3701.88,into our country and they're going to
3703.039,take the jobs and it's already started
3705.319,and you haven't seen anything yet it's a
3707.319,disaster you've 38 seconds left
3710.24,president Trump will you take any action
3712.48,as president to slow the climate crisis
3715.52,so I want absolutely Immaculate clean
3718.48,water and I want absolutely clean air
3721.68,and we had it we had H2O we had the best
3725.2,numbers ever and we did we were using
3729.24,all forms of energy all forms everything
3732.119,and yet during my four years I had the
3734.88,best environmental numbers ever and my
3738.279,top environmental people gave me that
3740.039,statistic just before I walked on the
3741.68,stage
3743.24,actually I don't know where the hell
3745.119,he's been
3746.44,the idea that a he said is true I've
3750.079,passed the most extensive most extensive
3752.92,climate change legislation in history in
3755.88,history we find ourselves and by the way
3758.52,black colleges I I came up with $50
3761.319,billion for HBCU historic black
3763.559,universities and colleges because they
3765.52,don't have they don't have the kind of
3767.96,contributors that they have to build
3770.839,these Laboratories and the like any
3772.92,black student is capable in College of
3774.559,doing what any white student can do they
3776.319,just have the money but now they'll be
3777.64,able to get those jobs in high-tech
3780.16,we're in a situation where the idea that
3782.72,he is claiming to have done something
3786.039,that had the cleanest water the cleanest
3788.599,water he hadn't done a damn thing in the
3790.799,environment he pulled out of the Paris
3792.88,peace Accord climate Accord I
3795.24,immediately joined it because if we re H
3797.799,1.5 degrees C at anyone point where
3800.68,there's no way back the only existential
3802.68,threat to humanity is climate change and
3805.039,he didn't do a dam Dam thing about it he
3806.72,must undo all that I've
3808.599,done the Paris Accord was going to cost
3811.4,us a trillion dollars and China nothing
3814.079,and Russia nothing and India nothing it
3816.559,was a ripoff of the United States and I
3819.76,ended it because I didn't want to waste
3821.92,that money because they treated us
3823.24,horribly we were the only ones it was
3824.799,costing us money nobody else was paying
3826.52,into it and it was a it was a disaster
3829.559,but everything that he said just now
3831.319,I'll give you an example I heard him say
3832.64,before insulin I'm the one that got the
3834.76,insulin down for the seniors I took care
3837.119,of the seniors what he's doing is
3839.2,destroying all of our medical programs
3841.4,because the migrants coming in they want
3843.76,everybody and look I have the I have the
3845.88,biggest heart on the stage I guarantee
3847.52,you that and I want to take care of
3849.319,people but we're destroying our country
3851.44,they're taking over our schools our
3853.24,hospitals and they're going to be taking
3854.799,over Social Security he is destroying
3857.359,Social Security Medicare and
3862.48,Medicaid the idea is that we in fact
3865.839,fact we were the only ones of
3868.68,consequence who were not who were not
3871.039,members of of the Paris Accord how can
3873.52,we do anything we've not able the United
3875.72,States can't get his under control one
3878.079,of the largest polluters in the world
3879.96,number one we're making significant
3881.88,progress by 2035 we will have cut
3884.52,pollution in half we have made we've
3886.96,made significant progress and we're
3889.039,continue to make progress we set up a
3890.92,climate Corp where thousands of young
3893.0,people will learn how to deal with clim
3894.839,just like the people core and we're
3896.88,going to we're moving in directions that
3898.72,are going to significantly change the
3900.64,elements of cause of pollution but the
3903.079,idea that he claims that he has the
3906.279,biggest heart up here and he's really
3907.72,concerned about about pollution and
3910.96,about climate I've not seen any
3913.119,indication of that and by the way with
3915.599,regard to prescription drugs one company
3919.799,agreed that they would reduce the price
3921.599,to $35 which I was calling for one
3924.44,voluntarily I made sure every company in
3927.16,the world every pharmaceutical company
3929.319,cannot have to pay and by the
3932.44,way so every day millions of Americans
3935.4,struggle just to make ends meet for many
3937.559,older Americans Social Security provides
3939.92,a critical Lifeline President Biden if
3942.279,nothing is done to Social Security
3944.319,seniors will see their benefits cut in
3947.279,just over 10 years will you name tonight
3950.2,one specific step that you're willing to
3952.2,take to keep Social Security solvent yes
3954.839,make the very wealth they began to pay
3956.319,their fair share right now everybody
3959.4,"making under $170,000 pays 6% of their"
3963.079,income of their paycheck every single
3965.48,time they get a paycheck from the time
3966.839,the first one they get when they're 18
3968.68,years old the idea that they're gon to
3971.24,I'm not I been proposing that everybody
3974.079,they pay the millionaires pay 1% 1% so
3978.88,no one after I would not raise the cost
3981.68,of social security for anybody under
3983.68,"$400,000 after that I began the make the"
3985.839,wealthy begin to pay their fair share by
3988.359,increasing from 1% Beyond to be able to
3991.24,guarantee the program for life so you
3993.72,still have 82 seconds left are there any
3995.68,other measures that you think that would
3997.039,be able to help keep Social Security
3999.079,solvent or is just is that one enough
4001.2,well no that that one enough will keep
4002.72,it solvent but the biggest thing I'll do
4005.0,if we defeat this man because he wants
4007.319,to get rid of Social Security he thinks
4009.44,there's plenty to cut in Social Security
4011.319,he's wanted to cut Social Security and
4012.799,Medicare both times and that's what and
4015.319,if look at the the program put forward
4017.559,by the house Republican caucus that he I
4020.48,believe supports is in fact want to cut
4023.16,it as well the idea that we don't need
4026.2,to protect our seniors is ridiculous we
4029.319,put we and by the way American public
4032.279,has greater Health Care coverage today
4034.079,than ever before and under the ACA as I
4036.839,said you're in a circumstance where
4039.64,"400,000 people 4 I mean 40 million"
4042.92,people would not have insurance because
4044.76,they have a pre-existing condition only
4046.839,allows them to have that insurance is
4048.96,the fact that they in fact are part of
4051.24,the ACA and by the way the other thing
4053.92,is we're in a situation where I talk
4055.839,about education for black communities
4058.279,I've raised the number the amount of
4061.0,"money for pel Grants another $8,000 so"
4063.76,"anybody making under $70,000 a year"
4066.52,"going to be able to get $115,000 toward"
4069.279,the tuition it's he he just doesn't know
4072.039,what he's talking about thank you
4073.4,President Biden president Trump so I've
4075.119,dealt with
4076.039,politicians all my life I've been on
4078.559,this side of the equation for the last
4081.359,eight years uh I've never seen anybody
4084.359,lie like this guy he lies I've never
4086.559,seen it he could look you in the face so
4088.72,about so many other things too and we
4091.48,mentioned the laptop we mentioned Russia
4093.24,Russia Russia Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine
4095.599,everything he does is a lie it's
4097.759,misinformation and
4099.719,disinformation uh the losers and sucker
4102.319,story that he made up is a total lie on
4104.319,the military it's a disgrace but Social
4107.719,Security he's destroying it because
4110.359,millions of people are pouring into our
4112.04,country and they're putting them on
4113.679,Social Security they're putting them on
4115.279,Medicare Medicaid they're putting them
4117.08,in our hospitals they're taking the
4118.92,place of our citizens they're what
4121.12,they're doing to the VA to our veterans
4123.279,is unbelievable our veterans are living
4124.96,in the street and these people are
4126.679,living in luxury hotels he doesn't know
4129.279,what he's doing and it it's really
4131.679,coming back I've never seen such anger
4134.199,in our country before
4136.159,President Biden the idea veterans are
4138.52,not being taken care of I told you
4140.08,before and by the way when I said
4141.759,suckers and losers he said he
4143.759,acknowledged after that he fired that
4145.759,General that General got fired because
4148.88,he's the one that acknowledged that
4150.48,that's what he said he was the one
4151.679,standing with Trump when he said it
4153.799,number one number two the idea that
4156.279,we're going to be in a situation where
4158.56,all these millions and millions of way
4160.96,he talks about it illegal aliens are
4163.159,coming into the country and taking away
4165.08,our jobs there's a reason why we have
4167.52,the fastest growing economy in the world
4169.759,the reason why we have the most
4170.88,successful economy in the world we're
4172.92,doing better than any other nation in
4174.4,the world and by the way those 15 Nobel
4177.52,laats he talked about being phony those
4179.839,15 Nobel laats economists they all said
4182.799,that if Trump is reelected we're likely
4184.64,to have a recession and and inflation is
4187.199,going to increasing and go up and by the
4189.08,way worst president in history 159
4191.6,presidential Scholars voted him the
4193.799,worst president in the history United
4195.64,States of America President Biden thank
4197.44,you so much let's turn to the cost of
4198.8,child care which many American families
4200.719,struggle to afford president Trump both
4202.76,you and President Biden have tried to
4205.12,address this issue but the average cost
4207.28,of child care in this country has risen
4208.8,"to more than $1,000 a year per child for"
4211.719,many families the cost of child care for
4214.239,two children is more than their rent in
4217.199,your second term what would you do to
4219.08,make child care more
4221.28,affordable just to go back the general
4224.12,got fired because he was no good and if
4226.6,he said that that's why he made it up
4228.239,but we have 19 people that said I didn't
4230.08,say it and they're very highly respected
4231.92,much more so than him the other thing is
4235.64,he doesn't fire people he never fired
4238.4,people I've never seen him fire anybody
4240.159,I did fire a lot I fired Comey because
4241.76,he was no good I fired a lot of the top
4243.48,people at the FBI drained the swamp they
4245.84,were no good not easier to fire people
4247.96,you'd pay a price for it but they were
4249.76,no good I inherited these people I
4251.159,didn't put them there I didn't put Comey
4252.48,there he was no good I fired him this
4255.04,guy hasn't fired anybody he never fires
4257.92,he should have fired every military man
4260.48,that was involved with that Afghan the
4263.159,Afghanistan uh horror show the most
4265.92,embarrassing moment in the history of
4267.48,our country he didn't fire did you fire
4270.0,anybody did you fire anybody that's on
4272.199,the border that's allowed us to have the
4274.04,worst Border in the history of the world
4275.52,did anybody get fired for allowing 18
4277.56,million people many from prisons many
4280.56,from from mental institutions did you
4283.32,fire anybody that allowed our country to
4285.44,be destroyed Joe our country is being
4288.4,destroyed as you and I sit up here and
4290.4,waste a lot of time on this debate this
4292.48,shouldn't be a debate he is the worst
4294.56,president he just said it about me
4296.12,because I said it uh but look he's the
4298.8,worst president in the history of our
4300.4,country he's destroyed our country now
4302.76,all of a sudden he's trying to get a
4303.92,little tough on the border he come out
4305.44,came out with a a nothing a nothing deal
4308.28,and it reduced it a little bit a little
4310.28,bit like this much it's insignificant he
4313.56,wants open borders he wants wants our
4315.639,country to either be destroyed or he
4317.48,wants to pick up those people as voters
4320.56,and I don't think we just can't let it
4322.88,happen if he wins this election our
4326.08,country doesn't have a chance not even a
4328.44,chance of coming out of this rut we
4331.52,probably won't have a country left
4333.159,anymore that's how bad it is he is the
4335.08,worst in history by far thank you
4337.4,president Trump President Biden we are
4338.84,the most admired country in the world we
4341.4,the United States of America there's
4343.679,nothing beyond our capacity we have the
4345.679,finest military in the history of the
4347.159,world the finest in the history of the
4349.12,world no one thinks we're weak no one
4352.159,wants to screw around with us nobody
4354.32,number one number two the idea that
4356.96,we're talking about worst Presidents I
4359.08,wasn't joking look it up go online 159
4363.08,or 58 don't H me the exact number
4365.92,presidential historians they had
4367.719,meetings and they voted who was the
4369.4,worst president in American history one
4372.0,through best to worst they said he was
4373.92,the worst in all of American History
4376.719,that's a fact that's not that's not
4378.76,conjecture he can argue they're wrong
4380.719,but that's what they voted the idea that
4382.719,he is knowing doing anything to deal
4385.0,with child care he did very for
4387.6,virtually nothing to child care we
4389.44,should significantly increase the child
4391.08,care tax credit we should significantly
4393.159,increase the availability of women and
4395.719,men or single parents to be able to go
4398.199,back to work and we should encourage
4400.239,businesses to hold to have thank you
4402.84,president bid president Trump the
4404.36,question was about what would you do to
4405.96,make child care more affordable if you
4407.199,want to take your minute just so you
4409.12,understand we have polling we have other
4411.679,things that do they rate him the worst
4414.159,because what he's done is so bad and
4416.239,they rape me I'll show you I will show
4418.0,you and they rape me one of the best
4419.96,okay and if I'm given another four years
4423.239,I will be the best I think I'll be the
4424.92,best nobody's ever created an economy
4428.239,like us nobody ever cut taxes like us
4430.88,he's the only one I know he wants to
4432.159,raise your taxes by four times he wants
4434.76,to raise everybody's taxes by four times
4437.679,he wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so
4440.44,everybody including the two of you are
4442.12,going to pay four to five times nobody
4444.08,ever heard of this before all my life
4446.0,I'd grow up and I'd see politicians
4447.679,talking about cutting taxes when we cut
4449.92,taxes as I said we did more business
4452.639,apple and all these companies they were
4454.639,bringing money back into our country the
4457.8,worst president in history by far and
4460.0,everybody knows it President Biden look
4462.52,the fact of the matter is that he's dead
4464.32,wrong about he's increased the T he's
4467.239,increased he will increase the uh taxes
4470.0,on middle class people I said i' never
4472.36,raise a tax upon anybody making less
4474.44,"than $400,000 I didn't but this tariff"
4477.36,is 10% tariffs everything coming in the
4479.52,country you know what the economists say
4481.44,that's going to cost the average
4482.639,American
4484.36,"$2,500 a year more because they're going"
4487.04,to have to pay the difference in food
4489.96,and all the things that were important
4492.0,number two he's in a situation where he
4494.76,told talks about how he has not raised
4498.28,he he's he somehow helped the middle
4500.52,class middle class has been devastated
4502.8,by you now you want a new tax cut of5
4505.44,trillion do over the next 10 years which
4507.719,is going to fundamentally bankrupt the
4509.56,country you had the largest deficit of
4511.48,any president American history number
4513.52,one number two you have not in fact made
4517.239,any contact any any any progress with
4520.679,China we are the lowest trade deficit
4523.199,with China since 2010 thank you
4525.76,president thank you president bu let's
4527.92,int let's discuss an epidemic impacting
4529.92,millions of Americans that both of you
4531.76,have made a top priority in your first
4533.44,term the opioid crisis and for both of
4536.48,you uh the number of Overdose deaths in
4539.6,this country has gone up under your term
4542.36,it went up under your term it has gone
4544.28,up former president Trump despite the
4546.44,efforts that both of you have made more
4548.44,"than 100,000 Americans are dying from"
4550.28,overdoses every year primarily from
4552.36,Fentanyl and other opioids what will you
4554.44,do to help Americans right now in the
4556.76,throws of addiction who are struggling
4559.08,to get the treatment they need to finish
4562.159,up we now have the largest deficit in
4565.08,the history of our country under this
4566.56,guy we have the largest deficit with
4568.96,China he gets paid by China he's a
4571.36,Manchurian Candidate he gets money from
4573.36,China we have so I think he's afraid to
4575.44,deal with them or something but do you
4577.4,notice he never took out my tariffs
4579.36,because we bring in so much money with
4580.96,the tariffs that I imposed on China he
4583.199,never took them away he can't because
4584.639,it's too much money it's tremendous and
4587.08,we saved our Steel Industries and there
4588.88,was more to come but he hasn't done that
4591.44,but he hasn't cut the tariffs because he
4593.56,can't because it's too much money but
4595.44,he's got the largest deficit in the
4597.52,history of our of our country and he's
4599.4,got the worst the worst situation with
4602.199,China China is going to own us if you
4604.28,keep allowing them to do what they're
4606.36,doing to us as a country they are
4608.28,killing us as a Country Joe and you
4610.52,can't let that happen you're destroying
4612.28,our country so president Trump you 67
4615.639,seconds left the question was what are
4617.28,you going to do to help Americans in the
4618.8,throws of addiction right now who are
4620.719,struggling to get the treatment they
4622.159,need Jake we were doing very well at
4624.159,addiction until the covid came along we
4626.4,had the two and a half almost three
4628.0,years of like nobody's ever had before
4630.04,any country in every way and then we had
4632.88,to get tough and it was the drugs
4635.04,pouring across the border were it
4638.48,started to increase we got great
4640.28,equipment we bought the certain dog
4642.08,that's the most incredible thing that
4643.92,you've ever seen the way they can spot
4645.52,it we did a lot and we had we were
4647.84,getting very low numbers very very low
4650.36,numbers then he came along the numbers
4652.96,have you seen the numbers now it's not
4655.12,only the 18 million people that I
4656.96,believe is even low because they the
4658.8,Goda ways they don't even talk about
4660.239,Goda ways but the numbers of the amount
4663.92,of drugs and human trafficking in women
4667.08,coming across our border the worst thing
4669.56,I've ever seen at numbers that nobody's
4672.28,ever seen under him because the border
4673.92,is so bad
4675.36,but the the number of drugs coming
4677.4,across our border now is is the largest
4679.56,we've ever had by far president Trump
4681.639,thank you President Biden Fentanyl and
4683.84,the byproducts fentanyl went down for a
4686.28,while and I wanted to make sure we use
4688.679,the Machinery that can detect fentanyl
4690.92,these big machines that roll over
4692.44,everything it comes across the border
4694.32,and it costs a lot of money that was
4696.12,part of this deal we put together this
4697.92,bipartisan deal more fentanyl machines
4700.96,more more be able to detect drugs more
4703.88,more numbers of
4705.4,of Agents more numbers of all the people
4707.96,at the border and when we had that deal
4710.48,done he went he called his Republican
4713.44,colleague said don't do it it's going to
4715.239,hurt me politically he never argued it's
4717.719,not a good bill it's a really good bill
4720.32,we need those machines we need those
4722.719,machines and we're coming down very hard
4724.8,in every country in Asia in terms of
4727.239,precursors for Fentanyl and Mexico is
4729.56,working with us to make sure they don't
4731.159,have the technology to be able to put it
4732.88,together that's what we have to do we
4735.04,need those machines thank you President
4737.36,Biden president Trump and again the
4739.0,question is about Americans in the
4741.08,throws of addiction right now struggling
4742.8,to get the treatment they need well this
4744.88,because this does pertain it to it he
4747.08,ended remain in Mexico he ended Catch
4750.08,and Release I made it catch and release
4751.92,in Mexico not catch and release Here we
4754.52,had so many things that we had done hard
4756.84,negotiations with Mexico and I got it
4758.639,all for nothing it's just like when you
4760.76,have a hostage we always pay $6 billion
4762.76,do for a host every time we say there a
4764.44,hostage
4765.4,now we have a hostage The Wall Street
4766.96,Journal reporter I think a good guy and
4771.0,he's over there because Putin is
4772.84,laughing at this guy probably asking for
4774.639,billions of dollars for the reporter I
4777.8,will have him out very quickly as soon
4780.88,as I take office before I take office I
4783.28,said by literally as soon as I win the
4786.4,election I will have that reporter out
4788.84,he should have had him out a long time
4790.28,ago but Putin's probably asking for
4792.4,billions and billions of dollars because
4794.199,this guy it every time we had two cases
4796.639,we paid $6 billion for five people I got
4799.92,58 people out and I paid essentially
4802.679,nothing thank you president Trump Dana
4805.159,let's turn to concerns that voters have
4807.239,about each of you President Biden you
4809.96,would be 86 at the end of your second
4813.0,term how do you address concerns about
4816.4,your capability to handle the toughest
4818.52,job in the world well into your
4821.0,80s well first of all I spent half my
4824.44,care being being criticized being the
4827.08,youngest person in politics I was the
4829.52,second youngest person ever elected the
4831.56,United States Senate and now I'm the
4833.4,oldest this guy's three years younger
4835.4,and a lot less competent I think that
4837.639,just look at the record look at what
4839.04,I've done look how I've turned around
4840.36,the horrible situation he left me as I
4842.92,"said 15 million new jobs 800,000"
4845.4,manufacturing jobs more investment in
4847.52,America over millions billions of
4850.159,dollars in private investment in in
4852.96,Enterprises that we are growing we by
4855.56,the way we brought a a lot of
4857.48,people the whole idea of computer chips
4860.4,we used have 40% of the market we
4862.36,invented those chips and we lost it
4865.04,because he was sending people to cheap
4867.32,to find the cheapest jobs overseas and
4869.679,bring home a product so I went I went to
4872.4,South Korea I convinced Samsung to
4874.719,invest billions of dollars here in the
4876.719,United States and they're guess what
4879.719,those Fabs they call to to to to build
4883.08,"these chips those Fabs pay over $100,000"
4886.36,you don't need a college degree for them
4888.32,and there's billions about $40 billion
4891.199,already being invested and being built
4892.84,right now in the United States creating
4895.04,significant jobs for Americans all over
4897.4,the from all over the world President
4899.52,Biden you have 40 seconds left would you
4901.48,like to add anything yeah I would the
4903.76,idea that somehow we are this failing
4907.44,country I never heard a president talk
4909.6,like this before we we're the NB of the
4912.44,world I name me a single major major
4915.28,country president who wouldn't trade
4917.04,places with the United States of America
4918.88,for all our problems and all our
4920.44,opportunities we're the most Progressive
4922.56,country in the world and getting things
4923.8,done we're the strongest country in the
4925.8,world we're a country in the world who
4927.52,keeps our word and everybody trusts us
4930.159,all of our allies and our and our op and
4933.0,our those who he cuddles up to from Kim
4935.92,jung-yong he sends Love Letters to and
4937.84,Putin Etc they don't want to screw
4940.08,around with us thank you former
4942.76,president Trump to follow up you would
4944.36,be 82 at the end of your second term
4947.44,what do you say to voters who have
4949.0,concerns about your capabilities to
4951.199,serve well I took two tests cognitive
4953.56,tests I aced him both of them as you
4955.679,know we made it public he took none I'd
4958.08,like to see him take one just one a real
4960.08,easy one like go through the first five
4962.04,questions he couldn't do it but I took
4964.12,two cognitive tests I took physical

4980.6,to be able to hit the ball a long way
4982.56,and I do it he doesn't do it he can't
4984.159,hit a ball 50 yards he challenged me to

4997.52,as good a shape as I was uh years ago I
5000.56,feel very good I feel the same but I
5002.36,took I was willing to take a cognitive
5004.159,test and you know what if I didn't do
5005.639,well I aced him Dr Ronnie Jackson who's
5009.36,great guy when he was White House doctor

5071.48,once all legal challenges have been
5073.44,exhausted that you will accept the
5076.239,results of this election regardless of
5078.159,who wins and you will say right now that
5081.76,political violence in any form is
5084.32,unacceptable well I shouldn't have to
5086.239,say that but of course I believe that
5088.28,it's totally unacceptable and if you
5090.719,would see my statements that I made on
5092.32,Twitter at the time and also my
5094.4,statement that I made in the Rose guard
5095.84,you would say it's one of the strongest
5097.32,statements you've ever seen in addition
5098.84,to the speech I made in front of I
5100.92,believe the largest crowd I've ever
5102.44,spoken to and I will tell you nobody
5104.48,ever talks about that they talk about a
5106.719,relatively small number of people that
5108.32,went to the capital and in many cases
5110.639,were ushered in by the police and as
5112.6,Nancy Pelosi said it was her
5114.6,responsibility not mine she said that
5116.6,loud and clear but the answer is uh if
5119.639,the election is fair free and I want
5121.719,that more than anybody and I'll tell you
5123.92,something
5125.28,I wish he was a great president because
5127.08,I wouldn't be here right now I'd be at
5129.44,one of my many places enjoying myself I
5132.44,wouldn't be under indictment because I
5134.04,wouldn't have been his political appoint
5135.679,you know opponent because he indicted me
5139.0,because I was his opponent I wish he was
5141.239,a great president I would rather have
5143.56,that I wouldn't be here I don't mind
5145.96,being here but the only reason I'm here
5147.56,is he's so bad as a president that I'm
5150.04,going to make America great again we're
5151.84,going to make America great again we're
5154.36,failing Nation right now we're a
5155.84,seriously failing nation and we're a
5158.04,failing Nation because of him his
5160.36,policies are so bad uh his military
5163.8,policies are insane they're insane these
5167.84,are Wars that will never end with him he
5170.04,will drive us into World War III and
5171.88,we're closer to World War II than
5174.48,anybody can imagine we are very very
5176.76,close to World War II and he's driving
5179.08,us there and Kim Jong-un and presiden of
5182.84,China Kim Jong-un of North Kore
5185.119,all of these Putin they don't respect
5187.4,him they don't fear Him they have
5189.8,nothing going with this gentleman and
5191.8,he's going to drive us into World War
5194.48,II you want a World War I let him follow
5199.0,and win and let Putin say do what you
5200.679,want NATO just do what you want there's
5203.44,a thing called Article Five an attack on
5205.88,one is Attack on all and required
5208.119,response the idea the idea I can't think
5211.96,of a single major leader in the world
5214.48,who wouldn't trade places with with job
5216.239,I've done and what they've done because
5218.719,we are a powerful Nation we have
5220.36,wonderful PE because of the people not
5222.239,me it's because of the American people
5223.92,they're capable of anything and they
5225.199,step up when they're needed and right
5227.08,now we're needed we're needed to protect
5229.52,the world because our own safety is at
5231.4,stake and again you want to have a war
5234.28,just let Putin go ahead and take keeve
5236.76,make sure they move on see what happens
5238.8,in Poland Hungary and other places along
5241.119,that border then you have a war
5244.32,president Trump as I come back to you
5245.92,for a followup the question was will you
5249.56,accept the results of this election
5251.88,regardless of who wins just to finish
5254.8,what he said if I might uh Russia they
5258.6,took a lot of land from Bush they took a
5261.159,lot of land from Obama and Biden they
5264.52,took no land nothing from Trump nothing
5267.4,he knew not to do it he's not going to
5269.679,play games with me he knew that I got
5271.36,along with him very well but he knew not
5272.84,to play games he took nothing from
5275.56,me but now he's going to take the whole
5277.96,thing from this man right here that's a
5281.159,war that should have never started it
5282.76,would have never started ever with me
5286.28,and he's going to take Ukraine and you
5289.08,know you asked me a question before
5290.44,would you do this would he's got us in
5292.28,such a bad position right now with with
5294.719,Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine's not
5297.36,winning that war he said I will never
5299.52,settle until such time they're running
5301.56,out of people they're running out of
5302.719,soldiers they've lost so many people
5304.159,people it's so sad they've lost so many
5306.92,people and they've lost those gorgeous
5308.8,cities with the golden domes that are a
5310.76,thousand years old all because of him
5313.199,and stupid decisions Russia would have
5315.6,never attacked if I presid the question
5318.28,was will you accept the results of the
5320.239,election regardless of who wins yes or
5322.84,no please if it's a fair and legal and
5326.08,good election absolutely I would have
5328.92,much rather accepted these but the the
5332.119,fraud and everything else was ridiculous
5335.199,and if you want we'll have a news
5336.44,conference on it in a week or we'll have
5338.52,another one of these on in a week but I
5341.6,will absolutely there's nothing I'd
5344.0,rather do it would be much easier for me
5346.04,to do that then I'm running again I
5349.639,wasn't really going to run until I saw
5352.4,the horrible job he did he's destroying
5354.8,our country I would be very happy to be
5357.239,someplace else in a nice location
5359.44,someplace and again no indictments no
5362.88,political opponent stuff because it's
5364.719,the only way he thinks he can win but
5366.679,unfortunately it's driven up by numbers
5368.639,and driven up up to a very high level
5370.88,because the people understand it let's
5373.36,see what your numbers are when this
5374.92,election is over let's see let's see
5377.44,you're a whiner when you lost the first
5379.679,time you you continued you appealed and
5382.199,appealed to courts all across the
5383.679,country not one single Court in America
5387.36,said any of your claims had any Merit
5390.08,state or local none but you continue to
5393.48,provoke
5394.719,this lie about somehow there's all this
5397.76,misrepresentation all this stealing
5399.88,there is no evidence of that at all and
5402.44,I tell you what I doubt whether you'll
5404.36,accept it because you're such a whiner
5406.44,the idea if you lose again you accepted
5408.52,anything you can't stand the loss
5410.44,something snapped in you in your loss
5411.88,the last
5412.96,time we'll be right back with more from
5416.6,the CNN presidential debate live from
5422.96,Georgia
5452.92,e
5482.92,e
5512.84,e
5542.84,e
5572.84,e
5602.76,e e
5639.719,it is now time for the candidates to
5641.239,deliver their closing statements as
5643.28,predetermined by a coin toss we're going
5645.48,to begin with you President Biden you
5647.679,have two
5650.679,minutes we've made significant progress
5654.159,from the debacle that was left by
5656.8,President Trump and in in his last term
5660.44,we find ourselves in a situation where
5662.4,number one we have to make sure that we
5665.0,have a fair tax system I ask anyone out
5667.679,there in the audience or anyone out
5669.639,watching this debate do you think the
5671.4,tax system is fair the fact is that I
5674.4,"said nobody even making under $400,000"
5677.36,had a single penny increase in their
5679.4,taxes and will not and if I'm reelected
5681.88,that'll be the case again but this guy
5684.719,is has increased your taxes because of
5686.8,the deficit number one he's increased
5689.48,inflation because of the debacle he left
5691.92,after the way he handled the pandemic
5694.4,and he finds himself in a position where
5696.52,he now wants to tax you more by putting
5698.8,a 10% tariff on everything that comes
5700.44,into the United States of America what I
5702.719,did when for example he wants to get
5705.0,away with get rid of the ability of
5707.679,Medicare to for the ability to for the
5713.28,US to be able to negotiate drug pra with
5715.28,the big farmer companies well guess what
5718.159,we got it we got it down to 15 excuse me
5721.639,$35 for insulin instead of $400 no more
5725.4,"than $2,000 for every senior no matter"
5728.92,what they how much prescription they
5731.119,need you know what that did that reduced
5733.92,the federal Deb debt by $160 billion do
5738.119,over 10 years because the government
5739.92,doesn't have to pay the exorbitant
5741.199,prices I'm going to make that available
5743.119,to every senior all all along it's
5746.679,happening now and everybody in America
5749.4,he wants to get rid of that we have I'm
5751.48,going to make sure that we have child
5753.0,care we we're going to significantly
5754.44,increase the credit people have for
5756.4,child care I'm going to make sure we do
5758.239,something about what we're doing on lead
5761.0,pipes and all the things that are
5762.96,causing health problems for people
5765.0,across the country we're going to
5766.679,continue to fight to bring down
5768.199,inflation and give people a break thank
5770.719,you President Biden president Trump you
5772.199,now have two minutes for your closing
5773.88,statement like so many politicians this
5776.44,man is just a complainer he said we want
5778.76,to do this we want to do that we want to
5780.56,get rid of this tax that tax but he
5782.96,doesn't do any think he doesn't do all
5785.04,he does is make our country unsafe by
5787.119,allowing millions and millions of people
5789.32,to pour in our military doesn't respect
5791.84,him we looked like fools in Afghanistan
5794.4,uh we didn't stop Israel it was such a
5796.88,horrible thing that would have never
5798.159,happened it should have never happened
5799.56,Iran was broke anybody that did business
5802.199,with Iran including China they couldn't
5804.239,do business with the United States they
5805.96,all passed Iran was broke they had no
5808.28,money for Hamas or Hezbollah for Terror
5810.76,no money whatsoever again Ukraine should
5813.679,have never happened he talks about all
5815.679,this stuff but he didn't do it for three
5817.0,and a half years we're living in hell we
5819.28,have the Palestinians and we have
5821.32,everybody else rioting all over the
5823.119,place you talk about Charlottesville
5825.4,this is a 100 times Charlottesville a
5827.28,thousand times the whole country is
5829.36,exploding because of you because they
5831.32,don't respect you and they have to
5833.08,respect their president and they don't
5834.84,respect you throughout the world what we
5837.639,did was incredible we re rebuilt the
5839.84,military we got the largest tax cut in
5841.92,history the largest regulation cut in
5843.96,history the reason he's got jobs is
5846.08,because I cut the regulations that gave
5847.92,jobs but he's putting a lot of those
5849.639,regulations back on all of the things
5852.199,that we've done nobody's ever never seen
5854.84,anything like even from a medical
5856.56,standpoint right to try where we can try
5858.719,Space Age materials instead of going to
5860.8,Asia or going to Europe and trying to
5863.199,get when you're terminally ill now you
5865.36,can go and you can get something you
5866.96,sign a document they've been trying to
5868.639,get it for 42 years but you know what we
5871.679,did for the military was incredible
5873.52,choice for our soldiers where our
5874.92,soldiers instead of waiting for 3 months
5877.32,to see a doctor can go out and get
5880.32,themselves fixed up and Reed up and take
5883.239,care of themselves and they're living
5885.0,and that's why I had the highest
5886.32,approval rating in the history of the VA
5888.84,so all of these things we're in a
5890.199,failing Nation but it's not going to be
5892.199,failing anymore we're going to make it
5893.599,great again thank you former president
5896.52,Trump President Biden
