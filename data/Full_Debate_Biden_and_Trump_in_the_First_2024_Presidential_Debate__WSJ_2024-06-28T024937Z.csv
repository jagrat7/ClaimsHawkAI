qqG96G8YdcE_3.0,"groceries that cost $100 then now costs more than $120 and typical home prices have jumped more than 30% what do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump we got to take a look at what I was left when I became president what Mr Trump left me we had an economy that was in freefall the pandemic was so badly handled many people were dying all he said was it's not that serious just inject a little bleach into your arm you'll be all right the economy collapsed there were no jobs unemployment rate Rose to 15% it was terrible and so what we had to do is try to put things back together again that's exactly what we began to do we created 15,000 new jobs we brought out position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs but there's more to be done there's more to be done workingclass people are still in trouble I come from Scranton Pennsylvania I come of household where the kitchen table if the things weren't able to be met during the mon was a a"
qqG96G8YdcE_4.0,problem price of eggs the price of gas the price of housing the price of a whole range of things that's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems and we're going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing we're going to make sure we build two two million new units we're going to make sure we cap rents so corporate greed can't take over the combination but of was left with in corporate greed is the reason why we're in this problem right now in addition to that we're in a situation where if you had take a look at all that was done in his administration he he didn't do much at all by the time he left there things were in chaos literally chaos and so we put things back together we created I said those jobs we make sure we had a situation where we now we brought down the price of prescription drugs which is a major issue for many people to $15 for for uh a insulin shot as opposed to $400 no senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug all the drugs they can include beginning next year in a situation as make and we're going to make that
qqG96G8YdcE_5.0,available to everybody to all Americans so we're working to bring down the price of around the kitchen table and that's what we're going to get done thank you president Trump we had the greatest economy in the history of our country we have never done so well every everybody was amazed by it other countries were copying us we got hit with covid and when we did we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929 but by the time we finished so we did a great job we got a lot of credit for the economy a lot of credit for the military and no Wars and so many other things everything was rocking good but the thing we never got the credit for and we should have is getting us out of that covid mess uh he created mandates that was a disaster for our country but other than that we had we had given them back a a country where the stock market actually was higher than preco and nobody thought that was even possible uh the only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs a
qqG96G8YdcE_6.0,bounceback from the co he has not done a good job he's done a poor job in inflation's killing our country it is absolutely killing us thank you President Biden well look the greatest economy in the world he's the only one that thinks that I think I don't know anybody else that thinks he's he the greatest economy in the world and you know the fact of the matter is that uh we PR ourselves in a situation where his his economy he rewarded the wealthy he had the largest tax cut in American history $2 trillion he raised a deficit larger than any president has in any one term he's the only President other than Herbert Hoover who's had lost more jobs than he had when he began since Herbert Hoover the idea that he did something that was significant in the military you know when he was president there were still killing people in Afghanistan he didn't do anything about that when he was President we were still find ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country the truth is I'm the only president
qqG96G8YdcE_7.0,this Century that doesn't have any this this decade that don't any troops dying anywhere in the world like he did uh president Trump I want to follow up if I can you want I allowed to respond to him well I'm going to ask you a follow up you can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you um I I want to follow up you you want to impose a 10% tariff on all Goods coming into the US how will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even higher not going to drive them higher it's just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years like China and many others in all fairness to China it's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money reduce our deficit tremendously and give us a lot of power for other things but he would he made a statement the only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history that's why we had all the jobs and the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounceback jobs you can't do that he also said he inherited 9% inflation now he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 4 15 months and then
qqG96G8YdcE_8.0,it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing and they don't know what they were doing it was the worst probably the worst Administration in history there's never been and as far as Afghanistan is concerned I was getting out of Afghanistan but we were getting out with dignity with strength with power he got out it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life president Trump over the last eight years under both of your administrations the national debt soord to record highs and according to a new nonpartisan analysis president Trump your Administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt while so far President Biden you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt so former president Trump many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year you want to extend them and go even further you say with the US facing trillion dollar deficits and record debt why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy
qqG96G8YdcE_9.0,that we've ever seen just prior to co and even after Co it was so strong that we were able to get through Co much better than just about any other country but we spurred that tax spurred now when we cut the taxes as an example the uh corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that uh we took in more Revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country the country was going like never before and we were ready to start paying down debt we're ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet the oil and gas right under our feet we were going to have something that nobody else has had we got hit with covid we did a lot to fix it I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the Therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with we we gave him something great remember more people died under his administration even though we had largely fixed it more people died under his administration than our Administration and we were
qqG96G8YdcE_10.0,right in the middle of it something which a lot of people don't like to talk about but he had far more people dying in his administration he did the mandate which is a disaster mandating it the vaccine went out he did a mandate on the vaccine which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine and he did a very poor job just a very poor job and I will tell you not only poor there but throughout the entire world we're no longer respected as a country they don't respect our leadership they don't respect the United States anymore we're like a third world Le between weaponization of his election trying to go after his political opponent all of the things he's done we've become like a third world nation and it's a shame the damage he's done to our country and I'd love to ask him and will why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country president Trump we will get to immigration uh later in this block President Biden uh I want to give you an
qqG96G8YdcE_11.0,opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt he had the largest national debt of any president fouryear period number one number two that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy I what I'm going to do is fix the tax system for example we have a thousand trillionaires in America I mean billionaires in America and what's happening they're in a situation where they in fact pay 88.2% in taxes if they just paid 24% or 25% either one of those numbers they'd raised $500 million billion dollars I should say in a 10-year period we'd be able to WR wipe out his debt we'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do Child Care Elder Care making sure that we continue to Str strengthen our health care System making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the uh with with the covid excuse me with um dealing with everything we have to do with uh
qqG96G8YdcE_12.0,look if we finally beat Medicare thank you president uh Biden president Trump well he's right he did beat Medicare he beat it to death and he's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in they're putting them on Medicare they're putting them on Social Security they're going to destroy Social Security this man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security these millions and millions of people coming in they're trying to put them on Social Security he will wipe out Social Security he will wipe out Medicare so he was right in the way he finished that sentence and it's a shame what's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed foreign countries I'm friends with a lot of people they cannot believe what happened to the United States of America we're no longer respected they they don't like us we give them everything they want and they they think we're stupid they think we're very stupid people what we're doing for other countries and they do nothing for us what this man has done is
qqG96G8YdcE_13.0,absolutely criminal thank you president Trump danana this is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned roie Wade this morning the Court ruled on yet another abortion case temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho despite that State's restrictive ban former president Trump you take credit for the decision to overturn roie Wade which returned the issue of abortion to the states correct however the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills they're used in about 2third of all abortions as president would you block abortion medication first of all the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill and I agree with their decision to have done that and I will not block it and if you look at this whole question that you're asking a complex but not really complex 51 years
qqG96G8YdcE_14.0,ago you had Ro v Wade and everybody wanted to get it back to the States everybody without exception Democrats Republicans liberals conservatives everybody wanted it back religious leaders and what I did is I put three great Supreme Court Justices on the court and they happened to vote in favor of killing Ro v Wade and moving it back to the States this is something that everybody wanted now 10 years ago or so they started talking about how many and how many this getting into other things but every legal scholar throughout the world the most respected wanted it brought back to the States I did that now the states are working it out if you look at Ohio it was a decision that was it was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought uh Kansas I would say the same thing uh Texas is different Florida is different but they're all making their own decisions right now and right now the states control it that's the vote of the people like Ronald re rean I believe in the exceptions I am a person that
qqG96G8YdcE_15.0,believes and frankly I think it's important to believe in the exceptions some people you have to follow your heart some people don't believe in that but I believe in the exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother I think it's very important some people don't follow your heart but you have to get elected also and because that has to do with other things you got to get elected the problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month the ninth month and even after birth after birth if you look at the former governor of Virginia he was willing to do this he said we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby meaning we'll kill the baby what happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue it's been a great thing thank you President Biden it's been a terrible thing what you've done the fact is that the vast majority of constitutional Scholars support it row when it was decided support it row and was that's this idea that they're all
qqG96G8YdcE_16.0,against it is just ridiculous and this is the guy who says the state should be able to have it we're in a state we're in six weeks you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not but you cannot see a doctor have your and have him decide on what your circumstances are whether you need help the idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying we're going to turn civil rights back to the States Let each state have a different rule look there's so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he he went to the funeral uh the idea that she was murdered by a by by an immigrant coming into they talk about that but here's the deal there's a lot of young women are being raped by their by their in-laws by their by by their spouses brothers and sisters by just it's it's just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state line thank you there have been many young women murdered by the same people he allowed to come across our border we
qqG96G8YdcE_17.0,have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world and he opened it up and these killers are coming into our country and they are raping and killing women and it's a terrible thing as far as the abortions concerned it is now back with the states the states are voting uh in many cases the it's frankly a very liberal decision in many cases it's the opposite but they're voting and it's bringing it back to the vote of the people which is what everybody wanted including the founders if they knew about this issue which frankly they didn't but they would have everybody wanted brought back Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back he wasn't able to get it everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back I was the one to do it and again this gives it the vote of the people and that's where they wanted it every legal scholar Wanted It That Way staying on the topic of abortion President Biden seven states I'll let you do that this is a same topic seven states have no
qqG96G8YdcE_18.0,legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy I supported row v Wade which had three trimesters the first time is between the woman and the doctor second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation the third time is between the doctor I mean between the woman and the state the idea that the politicians the that the founders want the politicians to be the ones making decisions about Woman's Health is ridiculous that's the last no politician should be making that decision a doctor should be making those decisions that's how it should be run that's what you're going to do and if I'm elected I'm going to restore roie Wade so that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth because some states Democrat run take it after birth again the governor former governor of Virginia put the baby down then we decide what to do with it so he's in
qqG96G8YdcE_19.0,he's willing to as we say rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby nobody wants that to happen democrat or republican nobody wants it to happen ly that is simply not true the roie way does not provide for that that's not the circumstance only if woman's life is in danger she's going to die that's the only circumstance which that can happen but we are not for late term abortion period period period under roie W you have late term abortion you can do whatever you want depending on the state you can do whatever you want we don't think that's a good thing we think it's a radical thing we think the Democrats are the radicals not the Republicans for 51 years that was a law 51 years constant of scholarship said it was the right way to go 51 years and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court he takes credit for taking it away what's he going to do what's he going to do in fact if the if the Maga Republicans he gets elected and the Maga Republicans control the Congress and
qqG96G8YdcE_20.0,they pass an Universal van on abortion period across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks something very very conservative is he going to sign that bill I'll veto it he'll sign it thank you let's turn down to the issue of immigration and border security President Biden a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago and in some cases causing Safety and Security concerns given that why should voters trust you to solve this crisis because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of Border Police there are now we significantly increased the number of Asylum officers significantly by the way the border patrol endorsed me endorsed my position in addition to that we find ourselves in a situation where when he was president he was taking separating
qqG96G8YdcE_21.0,babies from their mothers putting them in cages making sure they were the families were separated that's not the right way to go what I've done since I've changed the law what's happened I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where they're 40% fewer people coming across the border legally that's better than when he left office and I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the the the total initiative relative to what we can do with more border patrol and more Asylum officers president Trump I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence I don't think he knows what he said either look we had the safest Border in the history of our country the B all he had to do is leave it all he had to do is leave it he decided to open up our border open up our country to people that are from prisons people that are from mental institutions insane asylum terrorists we have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now all terrorists all over the world not just
qqG96G8YdcE_22.0,in South America all over the world they come from the Middle East everywhere all over the world they're pouring in and this guy just left it open and he didn't need legislation because I didn't have legislation I said close the border we had the safest Border in history in that final couple of months of my presidency we had according to border patrol who is great and by the way who endorsed me for president but I won't say that but they endorse me for president Brandon just speak to him but look we had the safest Border in history now we have the worst Border in history there's never been anything like it and people are dying all over the place including the people that are coming up in president Trump President Biden the only terrorist who's done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three under his administration killed an Al-Qaeda person come in and his administration kill three American soldiers kill three American soldiers that's the only terrorist that there I'm not saying it no terrorist ever got through but the idea they're emptying their prisons
qqG96G8YdcE_23.0,we're we're welcoming these people that's simply not true there is no data to support what he said once again he's exaggerating he's lying president Trump um staying on the topic of immigration you've said that you're going to carry out quote the largest domestic deportation operation in American history unquote does that mean that you will Deport every undocumented immigrant in America including those who have jobs including those whose spouses are citizens and including those who have lived here for decades if so how will you do it just one second he said we killed three people the people we killed are Al baghdaddy and salaman the two greatest terrorists biggest terrorists anywhere in the world and it had a huge impact on everything not just border on everything he's the one to kill people with the bad water including hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in we we are living right now in A Rat's Nest they're killing our people in New York in California in every state in the
qqG96G8YdcE_24.0,Union because we don't have borders anymore every state is now a border and because of his ridiculous insane and very stupid policies people are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never SE we call it migrant crime I call it Biden migrant crime they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before and you're reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days one of them I just spoke to the mother and they just had the funeral for this girl 12 years old this is horrible what's taking place what's taking place in our country we're literally an uncivilized country now he doesn't want it to be he just doesn't know he open the borders nobody's ever seen anything like and we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast because they're going to destroy our country just take a look at where they're living they're living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places our veterans are on the street they're
qqG96G8YdcE_25.0,dying because he doesn't care about our veterans he doesn't care he doesn't like the military at all and he doesn't care about our veterans nobody been worse I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA he has the worst he's gotten rid of all the things that I approved chice that I got through Congress all of the different things I approved they abandoned we had by far the highest and now it's down in less than half because he's done all these great things that we did and I think he did it just because I approved it which is crazy but he has killed so many people at our border by allowing all of these people to come in a very sad day Ander President Biden you have the mic every single thing he said Is A Lie every single one for example veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I P passed the pack attac one million of them now have insurance and their families have it their families have it because what happened whether it was agent orange or burn pits they're all being covered now and he oppos his group opposed that also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans
qqG96G8YdcE_26.0,my spent my son spent a year in Iraq living one next to one of those burn pits came back with Stage for G blastoma I was recently in in in France for a D-Day and I spoke to all about those Heroes that died I went to the World War II Cemetery World War I Cemetery he refused to go to he was standing with his fourstar General and he told me he said I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers my son was not a loser was not a sucker you're the sucker you're the loser president Trump uh first of all that was a madeup quote suckers and losers they made it up it was in a third rate magazine that's failing like many of these magazines uh he made that up he put it in commercials we've notified him we had 19 people that said I didn't say it and think of this who would say I'm at a cemetery or I'm talking about our veterans because nobody's taken better care I'm so glad this came up and he brought it up there's nobody that's taken better care of our soldiers than I have to think that I would in front of
qqG96G8YdcE_27.0,generals and others say suckers and losers we have 19 people that said it was never said by me it was made up by him just like Russia Russia Russia was made up just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking it's the same thing 51 intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation it wasn't that came from his son Hunter it wasn't Russia disinformation he made up the suckers and losers so he should apologize to me right now fourstar General standing at your side was on your staff who said you said it period that's number one and number two the idea the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the line we've done more for veterans than any president has in American history American history and they now are their family the only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and equip them when they go to war that's what we're
qqG96G8YdcE_28.0,doing that's what the VA is doing now they're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history all right thank you so much let's move to the topic of foreign policy I want to begin with Russia's war against Ukraine which is now in its third year former president Trump Russian President Vladimir Putin says he'll only end this war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it is already claimed and Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO are Putin's terms acceptable to you first of all our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy they can't stand him they think he's the worst commander-in-chief if that's what you call him that we've ever had they can't stand him so let's get that straight and they like me more than just about any of them and that's based on every single bit of information as far as Russia and Ukraine if we had a real president the president that knew that was respected by Putin he would have never he would
qqG96G8YdcE_29.0,have never invaded Ukraine a lot of people are dead right now much more than people know you know they talk about numbers you can double those numbers maybe triple those numbers he did nothing to stop it in fact I think he encouraged Russia from going in I tell you what happened he was so bad with Afghanistan it was such a horrible embarrassment most embarrassing moment in the history of our country that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned and so he's got no love loss but he should have fired those generals no General got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country Afghanistan where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated and by the way we left people behind too we left American citizens behind when Putin saw that he said you know what I think we're going to go in and maybe take my this was his dream I talked to him about it his dream the difference is he never would have
qqG96G8YdcE_30.0,"invaded Ukraine never just like Israel would have never been invaded in a million years by Hamas you know why because Iran was broke with me I wouldn't let anybody do business with them they ran out of money they were broke they had no money for Hamas they had no money for anything no money for Terror that's why you had no Terror at all during my Administration this place the whole world is blowing up under him President Biden I've never heard so much malar in my whole life look the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where let's take the last Point first Iran attacked American troops kill caused brain damage for a number of these troops and he did nothing about it recent when he was president they they attacked he said they're just having headaches that's all it is he didn't do a thing when they attack took place number one number two we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of of Afghanistan during that airlift number"
qqG96G8YdcE_31.0,"three we found ourselves in a situation where if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine he this guy told Ukraine told Trump do whatever you want and do whatever you want and that's exactly what Trump did to Putin encourage him do whatever you want and he went in listen to what he said when he went in it was going to take ke in five days remember because it's part of the old Soviet Union that's what he wanted to reestablish ke and he in fact didn't do it at all he didn't wasn't able to get it done and they've lost over they've lost thousands of thousands of troops 500,000 troops president Trump I come back to you for for one minute I just want to go back to my original question which is are Putin's terms acceptable to you keeping the territory in UK acceptable no they're not acceptable but look this is a war that never should have started if we had a leader in this war he led everybody along he's given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine he's given $200"
qqG96G8YdcE_32.0,billion that's a lot of money I don't think there's ever been anything like it every time that zalinski comes to this country he walks away with $60 billion do he's the greatest salesman ever and I'm not knocking him I'm not knocking anything I'm only saying the money that we're spending on this war and we shouldn't be spending it should have never happened I will have that War settled between Putin and zalinski as president elect before I take office on January 20th I'll have that War settled people being killed so needlessly so stupidly and I will get it settled and I'll get it settled fast before I take office President Biden you have a minute the fact is that Putin is a war criminal he's killed thousands and thousands of people and he has made one thing clear he wants to reestablish what was part of the Soviet Empire not just a pieace he wants all of Ukraine that's what he wants and then you think he'll stop
qqG96G8YdcE_33.0,there do you think he'll stop when he if he if he takes Ukraine what do you think happens to Poland what do you think bellarus what do you think happens to those NATO countries and so if you want a war you ought to find out what he's going to do because if in fact he does what he says and walks away by the way all that money we give Ukraine from weapons we make here in the United States we give them the weapons not the money at this point and and our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have that's why it's that's why we're strong thank you moving on to the Middle East in October Hamas attacked Israel killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages among those held and thought to still be alive our five Americans Israel's response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza President Biden you've put forward a a proposal to resolve this conflict but so far Hamas has not released the
qqG96G8YdcE_34.0,"remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza so what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war you have two minutes number one everyone from the United Nations secur security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Neto himself have endorsed the plan I put forward endorsed the plan I put forward which has three stages to it the first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions the third phase is no the end of the war the only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas number one they're the only ones standing out we're still pushing hard from to get them to accept in the meantime what's happened in Israel we're find the only thing I've denied Israel was 2,000lb bombs they don't work very well in populated areas they whole lot innocent people we're providing Israel with all the weapons"
qqG96G8YdcE_35.0,they need and when they need them and by the way I'm the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown intercontinental bistic ballistic missile attack on Israel no one was hurt no one Israeli was accidentally killed and it stopped we saved Israel we are the biggest producer of support for Israel of anyone in the world and so that's they're two different things Hamas can not be allowed to be continue we continue to send our experts and our intelligent people as to how they can get Hamas like we did Ben Laden you don't have to do it and by the way they've been greatly weakened toas greatly weakened and they should be they should be eliminated but you've got to be careful for what using certain weapons among population centers just going back to Ukraine for one second we have an ocean separating us the European nations together have spent a hundred billion or maybe
qqG96G8YdcE_36.0,more than that less than us why doesn't he call them and say you got to put up your money like I did with NATO I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars the Secretary General of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I've ever seen you wouldn't they wouldn't have any they were going out of business we were spending almost 100% of the money was was paid by us he didn't do that he's getting all you got to ask these people to put up the money we're over a hundred billion dollar more spent and it has a bigger impact on them because of location because we have an ocean in between you got to ask them as far as Israel and and Hamas Israel is the one that wants to go he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas actually Israel is the one and you should let him go and let him finish a job he doesn't want to do it he's become like a Palestinian but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian he's a weak one President Biden you have a minute I've never heard so much foolishness this is a guy who wants to get out of NATO are you going to stay in NATO he's
qqG96G8YdcE_37.0,going to pull out of NATO the idea that we have our strength lies in our alliances as well it may be a big ocean but we ever able to avoid a war in in Europe a major war in Europe what happens if in fact you have Putin continue to go into into NATO we have an article five agreement attack on one is Attack on all you want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about go ahead let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places see what happens then he has no idea what the hell he's talking about and by the way I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine including Japan and South Korea because they understand that this this this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace no no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe president Trump just to follow up would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region I'd have to to see but before we do that the problem we have is that we
qqG96G8YdcE_38.0,spend all the money so they kill us on trade I made great trade deals with the European nations because if you add them up they're about the same size economically their economy is about the same size as the United States and they were no cars no they don't want anything that we have but we're supposed to take their cars their food their everything their agriculture I changed that but the big thing I changed is they don't want to pay and the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars I said and he's right about this I said no I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay they asked me that question would you guard us against Russia at a very secret meeting of the 28 uh States at that time Nations at that time and they said no if you don't pay I won't do that and you know what happened billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months but now we're we're in the same position we're paying everybody's bills let's turn to the
qqG96G8YdcE_39.0,issue of democracy former president Trump I want to ask you about January 6 2021 after you rallied your supporters that day some of them stormed the capital to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes as president you swore an oath to quote preserve protect and defend unquote the Constitution what do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and in action on January 6 and worry that you'll do it again I don't think too many believe that and let me tell you about January 6th on January 6th we had a great border nobody coming through very few on January 6th we were energy independent on January 6th we had the lowest taxes ever we had the lowest regulations ever on January 6 we were respected all over the world all over the world we were respected and then he comes in and we're now left that we're like a bunch of stupid people that what happened to the United States's reputation under this man's leadership is horrible including
qqG96G8YdcE_40.0,"weaponization which I'm sure at some point you'll be talking about where he goes after his political opponent because he can't beat him fair and square you have 80 seconds left my question was what do you say to those voters who believe that you VI violated your constitutional oath through your actions in action on January 6 2021 and worry that you'll do it again well I didn't say that to anybody I said peacefully and patriotically and Nancy Pelosi if you just watched the news from two days ago on tape to her daughter who's a documentary filmmaker they say but she's saying oh no it's my responsibility I was responsible for this because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard and she turned them down and the mayor of in writing by the way the mayor in writing turned it down the mayor of of DC they turned it down I offered 10,000 because I could see I had virtually nothing to do they asked me to go make a speech I could see what was happening everybody was saying they're going to be there on January 6 they're going to be there and"
qqG96G8YdcE_41.0,I saidou know what there's a lot of people coming you could feel it you could feel it too and you could feel it and I said they ought to have some National Guard or whatever and I offered it to her and she now admits that she turned it down and it was the same day she was I don't know she can't be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar she said I take full responsibility for January 6th President Biden look he encouraged those folks who go up in Capitol Hill number one I sat in the dining room off the Oval Office he sat there for three hours three hours watching begging being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues on the Republican side as well to do something to call for a stop to end it instead he talked talked about these people being Patriots and and and great patrons of America in fact he says he'll now forgive them for what they've done he they've been con convicted he says he wants to commute their sentences
qqG96G8YdcE_42.0,and say that no but he went to every single Court in the nation I don't know how many cases scores of cases including the Supreme Court and they said they said no no this guy this guy is responsible for doing what is being was done he did do a damn thing and these people should be in jail and they should be ones are being held accountable and he wants to let them all out and now he says if he loses again such a Wier that he is that it could be a blood bath thank you President Biden president Trump what they've done to some people that are so innocent you ought to be ashamed of yourself what you have done how you've destroyed the lives of so many people when they RI down Portland when they rip down uh many other cities you go to Minnesota Minneapolis what they've done there with the fires all over the city if I didn't bring in the National Guard that City would have been destroyed when you look at all of the they took over big chunks of Seattle I was all set to bring in the National
qqG96G8YdcE_43.0,Guard they heard that they saw them coming and they left immediately what he said about this whole subject is so off peacefully patriotic one other thing the unselect committee which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now out of office and Democrats all Democrats they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right right we were right and they deleted and destroyed all of the information they should go to jail for that if a republican did that they'd go to jail thank you president Trump President Biden I want to give you a minute the only person on this stage is a convicted fellon and is the man I'm looking at right now and the fact of the matter is he isn't he's what he's telling you is simply not true the fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up in Capitol Hill and all those people every one of those who were convicted deserves to be convicted it the idea that they didn't kill somebody just went in and broke
qqG96G8YdcE_44.0,down doors broke the windows occupied offices turned over desk turn them over statues the idea that those people are patriots come on when I asked him the first two debates we had the debates we had first time around I said will you denounce the proud boy he said no I'll tell them to stand by the idea he's refusing to will you denounce these guys you denounce the people we're talking talking about now you denounce the people who attack that Capital what are you going to do I'm going to uh give you a a minute president Trump for a follow-up question I have um after a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month you said if reelected you would quote have every right to go after unquote your political opponents you just talked about members of the select committee on January 6 going to jail your main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents well I said my retribution is
qqG96G8YdcE_45.0,going to be success we're going to make this country successful again because right now it's a failing Nation my retribution is going to be success but when he talks about a convicted felon his son is a convicted Fon at a very high level his son is convicted going to be convicted probably numerous other times should have been convicted before but his Justice apartment let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things but he could be a convicted felon soon as he gets out of office Joe could be a convicted fellon with all of the things that he's done he's done horrible things all of the death caused at the the Border uh telling the Ukrainian people that we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor otherwise you're not getting a billion dollars if I ever said that that's quid proquo that we're not going to do anything we're not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son this man is a criminal this man you're lucky you're lucky I did nothing wrong we'd have a system that was rigged and disgusting I did nothing wrong thank
qqG96G8YdcE_46.0,you president Trump President Biden you have said I'm coming right to you sir you well you want to respond go ahead I'll give you a minute to respond the idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous it's simply a lie number one number two the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because your president is wrong is simply wrong no president's ever spoken like that before no present in our history has spoken like that before number three the crimes that you are still charged with and think of all the Civil penalties you have how many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for for molesting a woman in public for doing a whole range of things of having sex with a porn star on the night while your wife was pregnant I mean what what are you talking about you you have the morals of an alleycat give you a minute sir I didn't have sex with a porn star number one number two that was a case that was started and moved they moved a
qqG96G8YdcE_47.0,high-ranking official a doj into the Manhattan DA's office to start that case that case is going to be appealed in one we had a very terrible judge a horrible judge Democrat the prosecutor were all high ranking Democrats appointed people and the both the civil and the criminal he basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me but when the public found out out about these cases because they understand them better than he does he has no idea what these cases are but when he when they found out about these cases you know what they did my poll numbers went up way up you know that because you're reporting it and we took in more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in in the history of of any campaign I don't think any campaign has ever taken hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it's a scam and it's a guy that's after his political opponent because he can't win fair and square thank you president Trump president Biden you have said quote Donald Trump and his magga Republicans are determined
qqG96G8YdcE_48.0,to destroy American democracy do you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for president Trump will be voting against American democracy the more they know about what he's done yes the more they know about what he's done and there's a lot more coming he's got a lot of cases around the road coming around he's got he's got a whole range of issues he has to face I don't know what the juries will do but I knew and I do know he has a real problem and so the fact that could you ever think you hear any president say that I'm going to seek retribution you ever hear any president say that I thought Hitler had some good ideas what got me involved to run the first place after my son had died I decided in Iraq because of Iraq I said I wasn't going to run again until I saw what happened in Charlottesville Virginia people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches torches and and singing the same anti-semitic B they sang when back in Germany and what did and the young woman got killed they spoke to the
qqG96G8YdcE_49.0,mother and she they asked him they said what what do you think of those people the people who the ones who got killed the one who tried to stop it and the on he said I think they're fine people on both sides what American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields carrying torches singing the same anti-semitic B carrying swastikas were fine people this is the guy who says Hitler's done some good things I like to know what they are the good things Hitler's done that's what he said this guy has no sense of American democracy president Trump Jake both of you know that story has been totally wiped out because when you see the sentence it said 100% exoneration on that so he just keeps it going he says he ran because of Charlottesville he didn't run because of Charlottesville he ran because it was his last chance it he's not equipped to be president you know it and I know it it's ridiculous we have a debate we're trying to justify his presidency his presidency he's without question the worst president the
qqG96G8YdcE_50.0,worst presidency in the history of our country we shouldn't be having a debate about it there's nothing to debate he made up the Charlottesville story and you'll see it's debunked all over the place every anchor has de every reasonable anchor has debunked it and just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked it's a nonsense story he knows that and he didn't run because of Charlottesville he used that as an excuse to run president bid and debunk it happened all you have to do is listen to what was said at the time and the idea that somehow that's the only reason I ran I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy could get elected if he thought they were good people coming out of that all that Forest carrying those those woods carrying those torches that he didn't deserve to be president didn't deserve to be president at all and the idea that he's talking about all this being fabricated we saw with our own eyes we saw what happened on January 6th we saw the people breaking through the windows we saw people occupying that his
qqG96G8YdcE_51.0,own vice president look there's a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time his vice president hasn't endorsed him this time so why why they know him well they serve with him why are they not endorsing him thank you President Biden we're going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate e

qqG96G8YdcE_54.0,e e
qqG96G8YdcE_55.0,welcome back to the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia let's talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms and you'd certainly face again in a second term President Biden while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency black families still earn far less less than white families black mothers are still three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes and black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans what do you say to Black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress they acknowledge they made a lot of progress number one the fact of the matter is there's more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history number two the wages of black their black unemployment is the lowest level has been in a long long time number three we find find providing housing for
qqG96G8YdcE_56.0,black Americans and dealing with the segregation that exists among these corporate these corporate rations that collude to keep people out of their houses and in addition to that we find that the impact of on the the choice that black families have to make relative to child care is a incredibly difficult when we did the first major piece of legislation in the past I was able to reduce black child care costs I cut them in half in half we got to make sure we provide for child care cost we got to make sure because when you provide that child care protections you in increase economic growth because more people can be in the in the job market so there's more to be done considerably more to be done but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it you have 49 seconds left what do you say to Black voters who are
qqG96G8YdcE_57.0,"disappointed with the progress so far I say I don't blame them for being disappointed inflation is still hurting them badly for example I provided for the idea that any black family firsttime home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started I made sure that we're in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning that if they were engaged in nursing doctor and any anything having to do with volunteerism if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt all the rest is Forgiven after 10 years Millions have benefited from that and we're going to do a whole lot more for black families thank you president Trump and he caused the inflation he's blaming inflation and he's right it's been very bad he caused the inflation and it's killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody it's killing people they can't buy groceries"
qqG96G8YdcE_58.0,anymore they can't you look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled they can't live they're not living anymore he caused this inflation I gave him a country with no essentially no inflation it was perfect it was so good all he had to do is leave it alone he destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other all this money that's being thrown out the window he caused inflation as sure as you're sitting there the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the Border they're taking black jobs now and it could be 18 it could be 19 and even 20 million people they're taking black jobs and they're taking Hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it yet but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history thank you President Biden there was no inflation when I became president you know why the economy was flat on its back 15% unemployment he decimated the
qqG96G8YdcE_59.0,"economy absolutely decimated the economy that's why there was no inflation at the time there were no jobs we provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were in all communities including minority communities we made sure that they have health insurance we have covered if the ACA has incre I made sure that they're $8,000 per person and a family to get written off for healthare but this guy wants to Li that they tried 50 times he wants to get rid of the ACA again and they're going to try again if they win you find ourselves in a position where the idea that we're not doing any I put more we put more police on the street than any Administration has he wants to cut the cops we're providing for Equity equity and making sure people have a shot to make it there's a lot going on but in inflation he caused it by his tremendous amount feas into the the way handle the pandemic thank you another persistent challenge is the climate crisis 2023 was"
qqG96G8YdcE_60.0,the hottest year in recorded history and communities across the country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat intensifying wildfires stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels former president Trump you've vowed to end your opponent's climate initiatives but will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis well let me just go back to what he said about the police how close the police are to him almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J Trump almost every police group and what he's done to the black population is horrible including the fact that for 10 years he called them super Predators we can't in the 1990s we can't forget that super Predators was his name and he called it to him for 10 and they've taken great offense at it and now they see it happening but when they see what I did for criminal justice form and for the historically black uh colleges and universities where I funded them and got
qqG96G8YdcE_61.0,them all funded and the opportunity zones with with Tim as you know Tim Scott was incredible he did a great job great senator from South Carolina he came to me with the idea and it was a great idea it's one of the most successful Economic Development acts ever in the country opportunity zones and the biggest beneficiary are blacks and that's why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever they're saying ever I read this morning whereever the best numbers he's lost much of the black population because he's done a horrible job for black people he's also done a horrible job for Hispanics but way do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs and it's already started and you haven't seen anything yet it's a disaster you've 38 seconds left president Trump will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis so I want absolutely Immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air
qqG96G8YdcE_62.0,and we had it we had H2O we had the best numbers ever and we did we were using all forms of energy all forms everything and yet during my four years I had the best environmental numbers ever and my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage actually I don't know where the hell he's been the idea that a he said is true I've passed the most extensive most extensive climate change legislation in history in history we find ourselves and by the way black colleges I I came up with $50 billion for HBCU historic black universities and colleges because they don't have they don't have the kind of contributors that they have to build these Laboratories and the like any black student is capable in College of doing what any white student can do they just have the money but now they'll be able to get those jobs in high-tech
qqG96G8YdcE_63.0,we're in a situation where the idea that he is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water the cleanest water he hadn't done a damn thing in the environment he pulled out of the Paris peace Accord climate Accord I immediately joined it because if we re H 1.5 degrees C at anyone point where there's no way back the only existential threat to humanity is climate change and he didn't do a dam Dam thing about it he must undo all that I've done the Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars and China nothing and Russia nothing and India nothing it was a ripoff of the United States and I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treated us horribly we were the only ones it was costing us money nobody else was paying into it and it was a it was a disaster but everything that he said just now I'll give you an example I heard him say before insulin I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors I took care of the seniors what he's doing is destroying all of our medical programs
qqG96G8YdcE_64.0,because the migrants coming in they want everybody and look I have the I have the biggest heart on the stage I guarantee you that and I want to take care of people but we're destroying our country they're taking over our schools our hospitals and they're going to be taking over Social Security he is destroying Social Security Medicare and Medicaid the idea is that we in fact fact we were the only ones of consequence who were not who were not members of of the Paris Accord how can we do anything we've not able the United States can't get his under control one of the largest polluters in the world number one we're making significant progress by 2035 we will have cut pollution in half we have made we've made significant progress and we're continue to make progress we set up a climate Corp where thousands of young people will learn how to deal with clim just like the people core and we're going to we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the
qqG96G8YdcE_65.0,"elements of cause of pollution but the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about about pollution and about climate I've not seen any indication of that and by the way with regard to prescription drugs one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35 which I was calling for one voluntarily I made sure every company in the world every pharmaceutical company cannot have to pay and by the way so every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet for many older Americans Social Security provides a critical Lifeline President Biden if nothing is done to Social Security seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years will you name tonight one specific step that you're willing to take to keep Social Security solvent yes make the very wealth they began to pay their fair share right now everybody making under $170,000 pays 6% of their"
qqG96G8YdcE_66.0,"income of their paycheck every single time they get a paycheck from the time the first one they get when they're 18 years old the idea that they're gon to I'm not I been proposing that everybody they pay the millionaires pay 1% 1% so no one after I would not raise the cost of social security for anybody under $400,000 after that I began the make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share by increasing from 1% Beyond to be able to guarantee the program for life so you still have 82 seconds left are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent or is just is that one enough well no that that one enough will keep it solvent but the biggest thing I'll do if we defeat this man because he wants to get rid of Social Security he thinks there's plenty to cut in Social Security he's wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare both times and that's what and if look at the the program put forward by the house Republican caucus that he I"
qqG96G8YdcE_67.0,"believe supports is in fact want to cut it as well the idea that we don't need to protect our seniors is ridiculous we put we and by the way American public has greater Health Care coverage today than ever before and under the ACA as I said you're in a circumstance where 400,000 people 4 I mean 40 million people would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition only allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA and by the way the other thing is we're in a situation where I talk about education for black communities I've raised the number the amount of money for pel Grants another $8,000 so anybody making under $70,000 a year going to be able to get $115,000 toward the tuition it's he he just doesn't know what he's talking about thank you President Biden president Trump so I've dealt with politicians all my life I've been on this side of the equation for the last"
qqG96G8YdcE_68.0,eight years uh I've never seen anybody lie like this guy he lies I've never seen it he could look you in the face so about so many other things too and we mentioned the laptop we mentioned Russia Russia Russia Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine everything he does is a lie it's misinformation and disinformation uh the losers and sucker story that he made up is a total lie on the military it's a disgrace but Social Security he's destroying it because millions of people are pouring into our country and they're putting them on Social Security they're putting them on Medicare Medicaid they're putting them in our hospitals they're taking the place of our citizens they're what they're doing to the VA to our veterans is unbelievable our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels he doesn't know what he's doing and it it's really coming back I've never seen such anger in our country before President Biden the idea veterans are not being taken care of I told you
qqG96G8YdcE_69.0,before and by the way when I said suckers and losers he said he acknowledged after that he fired that General that General got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said he was the one standing with Trump when he said it number one number two the idea that we're going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions of way he talks about it illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs there's a reason why we have the fastest growing economy in the world the reason why we have the most successful economy in the world we're doing better than any other nation in the world and by the way those 15 Nobel laats he talked about being phony those 15 Nobel laats economists they all said that if Trump is reelected we're likely to have a recession and and inflation is going to increasing and go up and by the way worst president in history 159 presidential Scholars voted him the worst president in the history United States of America President Biden thank you so much let's turn to the cost of child care which many American families
qqG96G8YdcE_70.0,"struggle to afford president Trump both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue but the average cost of child care in this country has risen to more than $1,000 a year per child for many families the cost of child care for two children is more than their rent in your second term what would you do to make child care more affordable just to go back the general got fired because he was no good and if he said that that's why he made it up but we have 19 people that said I didn't say it and they're very highly respected much more so than him the other thing is he doesn't fire people he never fired people I've never seen him fire anybody I did fire a lot I fired Comey because he was no good I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI drained the swamp they were no good not easier to fire people you'd pay a price for it but they were no good I inherited these people I didn't put them there I didn't put Comey there he was no good I fired him this guy hasn't fired anybody he never fires he should have fired every military man"
qqG96G8YdcE_71.0,that was involved with that Afghan the Afghanistan uh horror show the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country he didn't fire did you fire anybody did you fire anybody that's on the border that's allowed us to have the worst Border in the history of the world did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people many from prisons many from from mental institutions did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed Joe our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate this shouldn't be a debate he is the worst president he just said it about me because I said it uh but look he's the worst president in the history of our country he's destroyed our country now all of a sudden he's trying to get a little tough on the border he come out came out with a a nothing a nothing deal and it reduced it a little bit a little bit like this much it's insignificant he wants open borders he wants wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters
qqG96G8YdcE_72.0,and I don't think we just can't let it happen if he wins this election our country doesn't have a chance not even a chance of coming out of this rut we probably won't have a country left anymore that's how bad it is he is the worst in history by far thank you president Trump President Biden we are the most admired country in the world we the United States of America there's nothing beyond our capacity we have the finest military in the history of the world the finest in the history of the world no one thinks we're weak no one wants to screw around with us nobody number one number two the idea that we're talking about worst Presidents I wasn't joking look it up go online 159 or 58 don't H me the exact number presidential historians they had meetings and they voted who was the worst president in American history one through best to worst they said he was the worst in all of American History that's a fact that's not that's not conjecture he can argue they're wrong
qqG96G8YdcE_73.0,but that's what they voted the idea that he is knowing doing anything to deal with child care he did very for virtually nothing to child care we should significantly increase the child care tax credit we should significantly increase the availability of women and men or single parents to be able to go back to work and we should encourage businesses to hold to have thank you president bid president Trump the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable if you want to take your minute just so you understand we have polling we have other things that do they rate him the worst because what he's done is so bad and they rape me I'll show you I will show you and they rape me one of the best okay and if I'm given another four years I will be the best I think I'll be the best nobody's ever created an economy like us nobody ever cut taxes like us he's the only one I know he wants to raise your taxes by four times he wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times he wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so
qqG96G8YdcE_74.0,"everybody including the two of you are going to pay four to five times nobody ever heard of this before all my life I'd grow up and I'd see politicians talking about cutting taxes when we cut taxes as I said we did more business apple and all these companies they were bringing money back into our country the worst president in history by far and everybody knows it President Biden look the fact of the matter is that he's dead wrong about he's increased the T he's increased he will increase the uh taxes on middle class people I said i' never raise a tax upon anybody making less than $400,000 I didn't but this tariff is 10% tariffs everything coming in the country you know what the economists say that's going to cost the average American $2,500 a year more because they're going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that were important number two he's in a situation where he told talks about how he has not raised he he's he somehow helped the middle"
qqG96G8YdcE_75.0,"class middle class has been devastated by you now you want a new tax cut of5 trillion do over the next 10 years which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country you had the largest deficit of any president American history number one number two you have not in fact made any contact any any any progress with China we are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010 thank you president thank you president bu let's int let's discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term the opioid crisis and for both of you uh the number of Overdose deaths in this country has gone up under your term it went up under your term it has gone up former president Trump despite the efforts that both of you have made more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year primarily from Fentanyl and other opioids what will you do to help Americans right now in the throws of addiction who are struggling to get the treatment they need to finish"
qqG96G8YdcE_76.0,up we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy we have the largest deficit with China he gets paid by China he's a Manchurian Candidate he gets money from China we have so I think he's afraid to deal with them or something but do you notice he never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China he never took them away he can't because it's too much money it's tremendous and we saved our Steel Industries and there was more to come but he hasn't done that but he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't because it's too much money but he's got the largest deficit in the history of our of our country and he's got the worst the worst situation with China China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they're doing to us as a country they are killing us as a Country Joe and you can't let that happen you're destroying our country so president Trump you 67 seconds left the question was what are you going to do to help Americans in the throws of addiction right now who are
qqG96G8YdcE_77.0,struggling to get the treatment they need Jake we were doing very well at addiction until the covid came along we had the two and a half almost three years of like nobody's ever had before any country in every way and then we had to get tough and it was the drugs pouring across the border were it started to increase we got great equipment we bought the certain dog that's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen the way they can spot it we did a lot and we had we were getting very low numbers very very low numbers then he came along the numbers have you seen the numbers now it's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low because they the Goda ways they don't even talk about Goda ways but the numbers of the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border the worst thing I've ever seen at numbers that nobody's ever seen under him because the border is so bad but the the number of drugs coming across our border now is is the largest we've ever had by far president Trump
qqG96G8YdcE_78.0,thank you President Biden Fentanyl and the byproducts fentanyl went down for a while and I wanted to make sure we use the Machinery that can detect fentanyl these big machines that roll over everything it comes across the border and it costs a lot of money that was part of this deal we put together this bipartisan deal more fentanyl machines more more be able to detect drugs more more numbers of of Agents more numbers of all the people at the border and when we had that deal done he went he called his Republican colleague said don't do it it's going to hurt me politically he never argued it's not a good bill it's a really good bill we need those machines we need those machines and we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for Fentanyl and Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together that's what we have to do we need those machines thank you President Biden president Trump and again the question is about Americans in the
qqG96G8YdcE_79.0,throws of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need well this because this does pertain it to it he ended remain in Mexico he ended Catch and Release I made it catch and release in Mexico not catch and release Here we had so many things that we had done hard negotiations with Mexico and I got it all for nothing it's just like when you have a hostage we always pay $6 billion do for a host every time we say there a hostage now we have a hostage The Wall Street Journal reporter I think a good guy and he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter I will have him out very quickly as soon as I take office before I take office I said by literally as soon as I win the election I will have that reporter out he should have had him out a long time ago but Putin's probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy it every time we had two cases we paid $6 billion for five people I got 58 people out and I paid essentially

qqG96G8YdcE_85.0,believe the largest crowd I've ever spoken to and I will tell you nobody ever talks about that they talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the capital and in many cases were ushered in by the police and as Nancy Pelosi said it was her responsibility not mine she said that loud and clear but the answer is uh if the election is fair free and I want that more than anybody and I'll tell you something I wish he was a great president because I wouldn't be here right now I'd be at one of my many places enjoying myself I wouldn't be under indictment because I wouldn't have been his political appoint you know opponent because he indicted me because I was his opponent I wish he was a great president I would rather have that I wouldn't be here I don't mind being here but the only reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president that I'm going to make America great again we're going to make America great again we're failing Nation right now we're a seriously failing nation and we're a failing Nation because of him his
qqG96G8YdcE_86.0,policies are so bad uh his military policies are insane they're insane these are Wars that will never end with him he will drive us into World War III and we're closer to World War II than anybody can imagine we are very very close to World War II and he's driving us there and Kim Jong-un and presiden of China Kim Jong-un of North Kore all of these Putin they don't respect him they don't fear Him they have nothing going with this gentleman and he's going to drive us into World War II you want a World War I let him follow and win and let Putin say do what you want NATO just do what you want there's a thing called Article Five an attack on one is Attack on all and required response the idea the idea I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade places with with job I've done and what they've done because we are a powerful Nation we have
qqG96G8YdcE_87.0,wonderful PE because of the people not me it's because of the American people they're capable of anything and they step up when they're needed and right now we're needed we're needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake and again you want to have a war just let Putin go ahead and take keeve make sure they move on see what happens in Poland Hungary and other places along that border then you have a war president Trump as I come back to you for a followup the question was will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins just to finish what he said if I might uh Russia they took a lot of land from Bush they took a lot of land from Obama and Biden they took no land nothing from Trump nothing he knew not to do it he's not going to play games with me he knew that I got along with him very well but he knew not to play games he took nothing from me but now he's going to take the whole thing from this man right here that's a
qqG96G8YdcE_88.0,war that should have never started it would have never started ever with me and he's going to take Ukraine and you know you asked me a question before would you do this would he's got us in such a bad position right now with with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine's not winning that war he said I will never settle until such time they're running out of people they're running out of soldiers they've lost so many people people it's so sad they've lost so many people and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are a thousand years old all because of him and stupid decisions Russia would have never attacked if I presid the question was will you accept the results of the election regardless of who wins yes or no please if it's a fair and legal and good election absolutely I would have much rather accepted these but the the fraud and everything else was ridiculous and if you want we'll have a news conference on it in a week or we'll have another one of these on in a week but I
qqG96G8YdcE_89.0,will absolutely there's nothing I'd rather do it would be much easier for me to do that then I'm running again I wasn't really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did he's destroying our country I would be very happy to be someplace else in a nice location someplace and again no indictments no political opponent stuff because it's the only way he thinks he can win but unfortunately it's driven up by numbers and driven up up to a very high level because the people understand it let's see what your numbers are when this election is over let's see let's see you're a whiner when you lost the first time you you continued you appealed and appealed to courts all across the country not one single Court in America said any of your claims had any Merit state or local none but you continue to provoke this lie about somehow there's all this misrepresentation all this stealing there is no evidence of that at all and
qqG96G8YdcE_90.0,I tell you what I doubt whether you'll accept it because you're such a whiner the idea if you lose again you accepted anything you can't stand the loss something snapped in you in your loss the last time we'll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia e
